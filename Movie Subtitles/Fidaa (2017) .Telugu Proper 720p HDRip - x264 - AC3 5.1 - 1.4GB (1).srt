Hey, bro! What's happening?

8
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,208
I am trying to make porridge.

9
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,833
Go ahead.

10
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,750
No! You do it.

00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,250
Go and wake up Bujji.

12
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,822
Bujji!

13
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,416
Bujji dear...

14
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,875
Hey, idiot!
How many times should I tell you?

15
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,041
Who will go to school?
Bujji! this is the last time.

16
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,458
Who cares!

-Hey, Varun. Hi..

39
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,750
Hey, Suz.

40
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,166
Hey! It's high time.
You need to get married.

41
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,458
-I need a friend.
-And you need a wife.

42
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,333
We need a family.

43
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,250
OK.

44
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,916
Oh, yes!
-Yes.

45
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,000
Hey, bro! 2 daughters! Dad is a
farmer and the mother passed away.

46
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,166
She pursued M.A. Psychology
and her name is Renuka.

47
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,500
Her sister is Bhanumati. She is pursuing
second year in B.Sc. Agriculture.

48
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,000
The interesting part is
they don't care about caste.

49
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,750
-Ohh!
-Date of birth is 15th September.

50
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,000
Hey, September 15th.

51
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,416
-That is Mom's birthday.
-Yeah.

52
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,083
Hey, go and meet her immediately.
Don't miss her.

53
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,500
-Yeah. Let's go.
-My sixth sense says that she's the one.

54
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,791
OK. Finish your exams.

55
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,583
No need. You guys leave.

56
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:08,666
I will come later.

57
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,458
Yes!

58
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,791
We're coming, India. Yay!

59
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,041
Don't pinch your nails! They might
assume you are not confidennt.

60
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,333
Look straight into her eyes. Be confident.

61
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,541
Don't smoke. Girls do not like it.

62
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,541
Don't be so serious. Keep smiling.

63
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,333
These are Bujji's pills. Keep them safe.

64
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,375
Be confident, man. All the best.

65
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,458
Bloody idiot! Are you a snob?

66
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,666
I will smash you. Don't try to act smart.

67
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,375
Hey! You said that you have class
but you still came.

68
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,625
My sister has got an alliance.

69
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,541
My dad messaged me.
I have to check it out, right?

70
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,208
It is a match from America.

71
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,708
Oh, wow! She'll accompany me in America.

72
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,250
You'll stay here anyway. So...

73
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,333
Go away! All of you leave!

74
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,041
Many guys tried to impress you
but you didn't give them a chance.

75
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,500
All you need is a guy from America.

76
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,750
His stature and income
should be better than us.

77
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,458
That's my choice.

78
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
Background chorus:
Go... go...

79
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,500
She's my wife.

80
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,458
She passed away
when Bhanu was 10 years old.

81
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,791
Sister, come here.

82
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:54,666
She's my sister.

83
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,333
-Greetings!
-Hi.

84
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,291
Greetings!

85
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
She nurtured my kids.

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,416
Ours was an inter-caste marriage.

87
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,750
That is why we perform
such rituals at home.

88
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,375
Sister! Get something to eat.

89
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,291
Hey! Just sit back.

90
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:27,666
Hey, wait.

91
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,583
We are against dowry, dear.

92
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,208
We are not likely to support dowry.

93
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,000
You don't have to mention that.

94
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,000
It is better to discuss
everything beforehand.

95
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
There comes Renu.

96
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,666
She's Renuka. She studied M.A. Psychology
and is a gold medalist.

97
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,333
Do you guys want to talk?

98
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,875
Go inside and talk.

99
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,208
-Excuse me.
-Hey!

100
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,583
I am Bujji.

101
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,458
Even I want to take a look.

102
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,791
Don't you know Telugu?

103
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, I know a little bit.

104
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,583
Give it here.

105
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,083
Why?

106
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,041
Nails are bad to keep at home.
I will throw it away.

107
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,083
-That's OK. I will throw it away.
-I will throw it. No problem.

108
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,041
-Just give it to me.
-It's OK.

109
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,791
-What's your name?
-Bhanu.

110
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,541
Man! This is funny shit.
I can't believe he is going to marry her.

111
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,166
That's right. This is just crap.

112
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,458
Crap?

113
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,916
It means shit in our language.

114
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:53,833
Cigarette?

115
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:55,541
Why?

116
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,250
I saw your profile picture.

117
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,583
I am asking because
I felt you might have that habit.

118
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,500
I can't do it here.

119
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,791
It is better to take a puff and
talk instead of sitting silently.

120
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,291
That's right.

121
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,833
Oh, man! They shut us up.

122
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,083
What do they do?

123
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,625
-Ah! Do they make out?
-What do you mean?

124
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,375
Would they kiss or something?

125
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,875
Shut up, idiot.

126
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,583
Sorry. I get tensed when I am with women.

127
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,833
I just needed the cigarette.

128
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,916
Are you OK with it?

129
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,583
I mean this arranged marriage.

130
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,583
Let me know if you're accepting
because of your dad or any pressure.

131
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,125
I will talk to your father.

132
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:00,833
I just want to clear this.

133
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,541
There is nothing like that.

134
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,875
I can talk to my dad
if I do not like the match.

135
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,708
You've got a Master degree in Arts, right?

136
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,875
-What are your hobbies?
-I sleep a lot.

137
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:18,375
You might have assumed that a village girl
will be homely, doing the house chores.

138
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,875
I just want to say that
I am not such a person.

139
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,833
Good! That's a very good hobby.

140
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,416
Interesting!

141
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,458
Whoa! What is this?

142
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,833
Help me out!

143
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,000
Please, help me out.

144
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:32,833
Hey!

145
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,541
That is just a buffalo.

146
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,666
Oh!

147
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,500
-Where do you get milk from?
-We buy it from the grocery store.

148
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,458
Come.

149
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,291
No! Don't take me there.

150
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,375
Let me go.

151
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,916
My brother will come and make a decision.

152
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:02,916
What?

153
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,333
Brother?

154
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,625
What's that, sister?

155
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,833
It will be a second
opinion if he sees her.

156
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,541
Second opinion?
What does he think of himself?

157
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,333
Let us reject the match.

158
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,458
We don't need this. Ask them to leave.

159
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,166
Arranged marriage itself is crap.

160
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,541
On top of it, there are conditions.

161
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,791
Sister! Reject him.

162
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,000
Shut up and eat.

163
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,375
They got no one.
That is why he said that.

164
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,750
It is better to think well
before the wedding.

165
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,750
We have to think twice. Not them.

166
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,458
Dad, you tell me. How can he say that?
Is she a thing?

167
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,250
We didn't make a decision yet.

168
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's see. Let that guy come.

169
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,000
What are you thinking?

170
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,166
Sister!

171
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,125
You will have a hard time serving those 3.

172
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,083
They live in America.
We don't even know their food habits.

173
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,041
Will it be shown in movies?

174
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,083
He does not have a personal opinion.

175
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,250
Think about it again.

176
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,791
Shall I tell dad?

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,416
Shut up and sleep.

178
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,250
Dad asked us to wait until he comes.

179
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,416
There's no touch and feel.

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,083
How can you accept it?

181
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,666
Shut up and sleep.

182
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,125
Lizards?

183
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,250
Come. I will show you.

184
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,166
He said they are from a
farmer's family in a village.

185
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,291
Could she be so modern?

186
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,833
Could he be that handsome?
Not at all.

187
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,208
But, he said that her sister will come.
She could be the one.

188
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,625
He's average. Let me give it a try.

189
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,208
Groom's brother.

190
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,500
Yeah. That's me.

191
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,583
Sorry. I didn't recognize you.

192
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,500
It has been many days that I read Telugu.

193
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,958
Moreover, you were holding it upside down.
It was kind of crazy!

194
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,958
I am Varun.

195
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,791
Sorry.

196
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,875
I am not used to the cars in India.
Cars in America are so strong.

197
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:44,291
So...

198
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,208
-This is India, sir!
-Shall I drive?

199
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,416
Hey, I am Varun. And you?

200
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,708
I am the bride's sister.

201
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,375
Why do you sound so threatening?
Are you angry with me?

202
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Do you have any problem?

203
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,000
Man! Damn roads! They never change.

204
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,875
Hello! These are our roads. We laid them.

205
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,708
We laid them the way we like.
Are you bothered?

206
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,125
No.

207
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,458
Right! Stay calm.

208
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,041
Everyone comments on the country.

209
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,083
Is it just you?
Or is your sister like you as well?

210
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,458
Don't say a thing about my sister.
She is precious.

211
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,208
Why are you laughing, man?

212
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,041
Is alliance a joke to you?

213
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,583
We had to go through many tensions.

214
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:51,041
Someone will come and
we should adorn ourselves for them.

215
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,291
We go through sleepless nights before
and after the meet.

216
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,291
How many of such alliances did you have?
You talk like an experienced person.

217
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,875
The groom won't simply tell his decision.

218
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,375
He wants his brother to see her.

219
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,000
That's when you come.

220
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,500
Is he crazy or what?

221
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,416
You can scold me but not my brother.
He is precious.

222
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,041
He's tensed.
That is why he needs a second opinion.

223
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,041
I should kill you.

224
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,958
It is my bad luck
to give a ride to such a guy.

225
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,541
I'm not enjoying the ride with you either.
I will get down. Stop the car.

226
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,666
Why did my brother stay at your house?
He should've booked a hotel room.

227
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,000
We offered and he stayed.
We did not plead him.

228
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,583
Let me get down. Please.

229
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,000
Stop the car.

230
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,500
My dad will kill me.

231
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,041
Why?

232
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,291
How can I insult the groom's family?
You came from afar.

233
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,666
I will follow you in an auto.

234
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,125
There's no need to tell him anything.
Please stop the car.

235
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,875
Seriously! Stop the car, OK.

236
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,875
Will you say that you do not like her
with this excuse?

237
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,583
The alliance is not a joke to us.

238
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,291
Hey! She agreed to wait until I came.

239
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,250
Your sister might have liked my brother.

240
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,458
You should respect that at least.

241
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,666
Hey! You know what?

242
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,041
You talk after yelling.
But, think well before you yell.

243
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,541
Try that. OK.

244
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,791
I don't have money.
-What for?

245
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,000
You are trying to preach me, right?
I don't take advice for free.

246
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,416
[chorus humming]

247
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,375
Yes!

248
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,125
No!

249
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,916
Hey, give me the chocolate back.

250
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,500
-No chocolates!
-Guys, listen.

251
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,500
I like Renuka very much.

252
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,166
I think I really like her.

253
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,333
Whoa! Finally!

254
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,791
Whoop!

255
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,500
Awesome, bro.

256
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,166
And you! You just go and say OK. Alright?

257
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,791
Then, why did you tell them that
I should make a decision?

258
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,333
Ouch!

259
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,333
They should know that
we are close to each other. Right?

260
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,083
She's a good person.

261
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,291
I don't know about her.
But, her sister is different.

262
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,833
I think she's kind of crazy, man.
She left me there.

263
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,750
Why are we staying here?
It would be nice to stay at a hotel.

264
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,083
They requested me a lot
and didn't let me go.

265
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,958
Listen! Just go and say OK.

266
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,625
Don't trouble them. OK.

267
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,500
OK, Chief.

268
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:33,750
Bujji, come.

269
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,458
-Yeah! We're getting our sister-in-law.
-Whoa! We're getting a sister-in-law.

270
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,083
Waiting for my decision is just a game.

271
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,875
You should accept him.

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He is always caught up with work.

273
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,875
He doesn't socialize much.
He is a workaholic.

274
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,625
You take care of him and
we will take care of you.

275
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,041
-We do all the work. Right, Bujji?
-Yeah.

276
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:58,666
Yeah.

277
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,875
You can if you want to or study.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,958
It will be nice there.

279
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,625
He likes you a lot.
He spoke highly of you.

280
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,416
You guys will be good together,
sister-in-law.

281
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,250
Can I call you that?

282
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,500
Yes.

283
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,375
Why don't you say
something about yourself?

284
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,875
There's nothing about me.
I am just an average guy.

285
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,750
He is special.
We're at this stage because of him.

286
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,500
He's our hero.

287
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,833
I didn't understand all of that
but they seem very nice to me, madam.

288
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,875
I doubt it. How can they be so nice?

289
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,791
We cannot trust them.

290
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,041
I have to test them.

291
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,166
-Hey.
-Hey.

292
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,291
How's it going?

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,333
Hey, bro! Meet my sister-in-law Renuka.

294
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,583
Sister-in-law! Meet my brother Raju.

295
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:49,666
Bro.

296
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,833
Bujji, let's go.

297
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,041
For you.

298
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey, Bhanu!

299
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,125
What is it, Aunt?

300
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,666
Go fast and get eggs and
chickpea flour. Go.

301
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,500
Hustle up!

302
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,875
Can't you hear me?

303
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,791
Go fast.

304
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,208
Run!

305
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,500
I am going to the market. Will you come?

306
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,125
Will you come along with me to the market?
-Are you asking me to come?

307
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,041
You asked me out of the car yesterday.
But you're inviting me now. Is it okay?

308
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,958
Sir! Don't get any ideas.

309
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,708
I am doing this task for you.
That is why I asked you to come.

310
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,375
You are our guests.
We never know if you'll stay or leave.

311
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,458
All you can eat at this hour is an omelet.

312
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,291
That is why my aunt asked me to get eggs.

313
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,458
But, I got some work.
Come and see around the village.

314
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,708
Alright. Just give me a minute.

315
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,000
Whoa! What's wrong?

316
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,416
-Will you come like this?
-Why not? I am comfortable.

317
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,458
-Do you guys wear underpants around?
-These are shorts. Not underpants.

318
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,791
I dress according to the season.
Anyway! I am comfortable.

319
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,458
-Do you have an issue?
-I don't have any issue.

320
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,875
Girls in the village can't resist
seeing you like that with bare legs.

321
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,625
What do you do? I mean in America.

322
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,958
-I study medicine. I'm gonna be a doctor.
-Oh! Broiler Chicken?

323
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,166
Ah?

324
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,250
Everyone here is either
a doctor or an engineer.

-Sardar Gabbarsingh' movie?
-No!

00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,291
-Hey, wait.
-Hey!

483
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,125
What about that traditional attire?
I heard there is no such tradition.

484
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,833
Hey! You look good in it.
You will feel free.

485
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,083
That's not the point.
How can you cheat like that?

486
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:16,916
Conspiracy!

487
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I couldn't sleep because of the lizards.

488
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,958
-You asked for the pickle.
-Oh, man!

489
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,375
I tried so hard and got it.
Who will eat that now?

490
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:24,500
Did you keep that in mind?

491
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,333
Shall I tell your aunt?

492
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,333
Will you?
Will you tell my aunt?

493
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,291
I might. Suppose.

494
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:35,166
Oh, shit!

495
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:37,416
Did you click my pictures in the morning?

496
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,541
Don't say shit. Say 'bloody' instead.
You will feel good.

497
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,625
-Try it.
-You are crazy.

498
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,458
You look good.

499
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,541
I got many adult-rated pictures.
Care to watch them?

500
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,125
Where? Hey! Bhanu...

501
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,791
When did Indian girls change like this?

502
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,916
Don't generalize.

503
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,625
It is just me. Bhanumati! All in one.
A family with 2 religions and castes.

504
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,666
Hybrid girl!

505
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,125
You and your language of agriculture.

506
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,666
-Is your brother a good man?
-Why?

507
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,750
My sister is so good.
She's not like me.

508
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,000
She doesn't get angry or hurt anyone.

509
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,375
She is very good.

510
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,791
How about your brother?

511
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:54,083
We know that your sister is precious.

512
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,583
Don't you know how my brother is?

513
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,333
We do. But, there's a little fear.

514
00:34:58,708 --> 00:34:59,708
Fear? Why?

515
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,250
She leaves us behind to come be with you.

516
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:03,833
Don't worry.

517
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,708
-Promise?
-Promise.

518
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:13,416
Hey!

519
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,125
When are you taking me to
Mallana temple?

520
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,416
Pray for it and it will come true.

521
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:29,625
Pray!

522
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:35,875
He is my brother-in-law's brother.

523
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,750
-It is beautiful.
-This is our village.

524
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,833
Wake up in the morning then I dab...

525
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,333
Wake up in the morning then I dab...

526
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,208
Thanks.

527
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,041
-I need toilet paper! 
-You wait.

528
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,083
Hey, Bujji! Come here.

529
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,666
Toilet paper!
I need toilet paper.

530
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:15,708
-Here. Take water.
-No!

531
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:16,833
Bujji, no! Use water.

532
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,416
-No! 
-Bujji, use water.

533
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,250
-Toilet paper.
-Hey, Bujji! Here...

534
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,791
-Toilet paper.
-No!

535
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:24,250
Crazy!

536
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:44,666
There! It's there!

537
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,791
-Lizards won't come now.
-Thank you, Bhanu sis.

538
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:58,708
How's it?

539
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,244
Water from our well.

540
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,708
-Really?
-Yeah.

541
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,526
Good.

542
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,014
This land is 10 acres on the whole, Sir.

543
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,541
Including the area up there and under...

544
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,250
-What about that?
-Yeah. All of it.

545
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,583
-Greetings, Sir.
-Greetings.

546
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,666
This is the one, Sir.
-OK.

547
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,583
-Who are you? Are you the owner of it?
-No, Sir.

548
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,708
I leased it for farming.
It has been 20 years.

549
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:40,791
Take this, Sir.

550
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,375
Look at this. This is that bit.

551
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,293
It tastes good.

552
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,750
We get an amazing harvest, sir.

553
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,541
What do you get from it?
He's selling it, right?

554
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:51,048
I came to you regarding that, Sir.

555
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:56,375
You might construct a building. So,
I request you to get me a job there.

556
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,708
-Will you do the labor work?
-We don't have another choice, Sir.

557
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,541
It's OK, dad.

558
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:09,958
Hey!

559
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:17,583
Did you buy the lands?

560
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:20,458
We are still looking.
Its the land grandpa does farming in.

561
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:25,583
You don't think before buying.
You wouldn't stop until fields go barren.

562
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,401
You look amazing. Beautiful.

563
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:28,750
-Huh?
-Cool.

564
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,583
You might've never seen a
girl who sweats it out.

565
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:35,500
You must've only seen girls who
are glued to their gadgets.

566
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,625
Bloody! Have you gone crazy? Mad fellow!

567
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,625
Sorry. I wanted to see you. So...

568
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:57,875
Crazy!

569
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,500
You saw me near the well, right?
Shouldn't I see you?

570
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:04,875
Why'd you play such tricks?
You could just ask.

571
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,771
Ask for it and you'll get it.

572
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:10,389
Whoa!

573
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:30,750
"He's here. He's in no hurry"

574
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,951
"He worked his flattery"

575
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:37,592
"He won't let you stay calm or steady"

576
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,893
"He threw a smile at you"

577
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,213
"He gave you sleepless nights"

578
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:47,449
"He keeps hunger away by
disturbing you a lot"

579
00:39:55,666 --> 00:40:00,291
"Renuka dear! Your man is here"

580
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:04,875
"He asks you out on a dinner date"

581
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:10,541
"He held your hand making
you go topsy-turvy"

582
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:17,180
"He's here. He's in no hurry"

583
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,484
"He worked his flattery"

584
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:24,140
"He won't let you stay calm or steady"

585
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,540
"He threw a smile at you"

586
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,866
"He gave you sleepless nights"

587
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:33,208
"He keeps hunger away by
disturbing you a lot"

588
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,049
"Renuka dear! Your man is here"

589
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:42,224
"He is here!"

590
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:05,686
"Men are tricksters! "

591
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:10,145
"Men are tricksters,
trying to impress you"

592
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:14,638
"You shouldn't be easy on them"

593
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:18,840
"Accept and reject his wishes at times"

594
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:23,958
"Maintain this and
he will stay with you for life"

595
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:30,591
"He's here. He's in no hurry"

596
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,868
"He worked his flattery"

597
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:37,621
"He won't let you stay calm or steady"

598
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,888
"He threw a smile at you"

599
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,228
"He gave you sleepless nights"

600
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:47,041
"He keeps hunger away by
disturbing you a lot"

601
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:19,080
"Oh, my! He's so tall! "

602
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:23,639
"Oh, my! How does one manage to kiss him?"

603
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,322
"Oh, my! How does one manage to kiss him?"

604
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:32,494
"He can't be reached unless
a ladder is in hand"

605
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,029
"I know the technique of
holding you by the waist to kiss you"

606
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:44,774
"Don't you worry"

607
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:48,624
"He's here. He's in no hurry"

608
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,022
"He worked his flattery"

609
00:42:51,222 --> 00:42:55,621
"He won't let you stay calm or steady"

610
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:57,933
"He threw a smile at you"

611
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:00,277
"He gave you sleepless nights"

612
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:04,537
"He keeps hunger away by
disturbing you a lot"

613
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:29,958
How much did you study?

614
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:33,108
Shame on you!
Why'd you have to study so fast?

615
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,625
I just started.

616
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,999
Hey! Did you change already?

617
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,757
I will fail if I do not study.

618
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:56,020
Hey!

619
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,833
Your dance was too good. Awesome!

620
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:04,833
What's up with the land?

621
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,923
We bought the land
and gave it on lease to grandpa.

622
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,666
Grandpa is happy. The crop land
is in good hands and we're happy.

623
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:16,449
Real Estate agents won't
bother you anymore.

624
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,375
You did a good thing.

625
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:24,375
I didn't expect this from you.
I am impressed.

626
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:25,625
Ah?

627
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,541
Impressed!

628
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,374
Hey! Do you want me to
help with your exams?

629
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:37,324
I can read the chapter
and help you out.

630
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:43,458
Come that way.

631
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,000
Say it again.

632
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,958
Come that way.

633
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:50,833
You sounded great.

634
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,608
Alright. Give me a couple of minutes.
I will change and come.

635
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,250
Cool room!

636
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,208
Did you click my pictures from here?

637
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:14,458
Thanks.

638
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:16,458
So!

639
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,416
Draw these diagrams and graphs.

640
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:20,958
Yeah. OK.

641
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,125
-Can you do it?
-Yeah.

642
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:32,041
Will you understand anything
from copying and reading?

643
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:35,572
-You need to understand the concept.
-Get to it. I know what to do.

644
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,125
Oops!

645
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,500
Wait. I will give you the rubber.

646
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,416
-Give me what?
-A rubber...

647
00:45:51,304 --> 00:45:54,012
Condoms are called rubbers in the US.

648
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,208
Shy, eh!

649
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,833
Is that making you shy?

650
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:04,476
Condoms are advertised
in India to avoid AIDS.

651
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,493
Millions are spent on
these advertisements.

652
00:46:06,693 --> 00:46:07,341
Oh!

653
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,458
Looks like you are an expert at this.

654
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,458
Man!

655
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:13,834
Won't you let me be?
Everything seems likes a test.

656
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,083
Nothing like that.

657
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:19,534
Why do you care about what I think?

658
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:23,839
Bhanu! No one wants to be the
bad guy in front of girls.

659
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,458
Care for a tea?

660
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:28,416
Yeah.

661
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,291
Where's the tea powder?

662
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:04,708
Yeah. It's done.

663
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:05,833
Thank you.

664
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,208
Do you cook?

665
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,541
Not just cooking.
We take care of everything for Bujji.

666
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:25,291
Bathing, feeding, diaper changing!
Everything.

667
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,267
Sister-in-law won't have a problem
with that.

668
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,228
Was Bujji a late born child?

669
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:31,541
Actually...

670
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:33,708
My mom adopted him.

671
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,333
We wanted to adopt a baby girl.
But, that didn't work out.

672
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,291
My mom passed away
when Bujji was 2 years old.

673
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,416
She loved him like anything.

674
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,458
Does Bujji know?

675
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,541
He knows.

676
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,208
Actually, he talks about it with pride.

677
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:50,339
He feels we were simply born
where as he was chosen by mom.

678
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:55,541
I was doubtful about you
guys but it's cleared.

679
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:57,916
She'll be happy. I can sense that.

680
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,916
You always think in favour of your sister.

681
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:03,875
Don't you notice us? Is that it?

682
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,617
Does your world revolve around her?

683
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,000
OK. Forget about your sister.

684
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,500
What do you think about me?

685
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,219
Why?

686
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,291
Hey! Just say it.

687
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:18,291
Oh, my!

688
00:48:20,895 --> 00:48:23,145
I'll fail in my exam. Shall we start?

689
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,292
OK. Let's go.

690
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,125
So, the earthworm helps the farmers
by preventing soil erosion...

691
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,817
...and they help to discern the soil.

692
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,375
I have to give medicine to my dad.
I am leaving.

693
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,475
Hey! We are going to
your collegeat 9, right?

694
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:54,333
Dad! Get up.

695
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:56,833
-What is it, dear?
-Pills.

696
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:04,958
Sorry, dad.

697
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,250
I forgot about it. It is my mistake.

698
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,125
Why are you acting like a kid?

699
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,791
You have an exam tomorrow.
Go and sleep.

700
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:14,375
Sorry, dad.

701
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:16,375
I wasn't mindful.

702
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,501
Dad! I am your precious one, right?

703
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:30,375
You are very precious. You are my life.

704
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,333
I will always be with you.
I won't go anywhere.

705
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,666
We have our land, Mallana temple,
and our village.

706
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:37,848
Hey, go!

707
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,000
Go. Hey, you!

708
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:45,791
I am not going anywhere.

709
00:49:58,625 --> 00:49:59,958
Did he come to your room?

710
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,125
Oh, my gosh!

711
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,250
You won't let anyone into
your room, right?

712
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,041
So, do you like him?

713
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,375
It was a weak moment.

714
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,750
He disturbs me a lot.

715
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,625
One reason!

716
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:13,166
I need just one reason
to get him off my mind.

717
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,208
He's not the right one for me.

718
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:18,883
I can't leave everything behind for him.

719
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:20,370
Stay with me.

720
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,291
I will say that we're going
to the exam together.

721
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:22,583
Ah?

722
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:26,505
I only asked him to come
along to our college.

723
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,166
I get it! Weak moment, am I right?

724
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:33,416
No! I see danger. Let's go.

725
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,439
Hey! He's here. Look...

726
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,533
My heart is pounding.

727
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,333
Look... It's okay.
Just take a look.

728
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,166
He came for you. Don't
make yourself look bad.

729
00:50:57,666 --> 00:51:00,750
-Let's go. We might be late for our exam.
-OK. Let's get changed.

730
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:01,583
Now?

731
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,416
How can we go like this?
Look at your dress.

732
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,168
Guys will tease you if you go like this.

733
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:09,208
You know Naresh is
always staring at you.

734
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:11,208
We don't have time. He might come.

735
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:11,916
Let's go.

736
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:36,791
Hey, Bhanu!

737
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:38,041
Bhanu!

738
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:48,975
Have you seen the question paper, man?'

739
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:50,426
Have you seen Bhanu?'

740
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:52,293
-Have you seen her mole?
-No, buddy.

741
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:54,375
I can't resist touching her.

742
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:55,625
-Soil strain?
-Yeah. I wrote that one.

743
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,791
Hey.

744
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,708
-Hi.
-Hi.

745
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:05,708
What are you doing here?

746
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:08,308
If I don't show up,
you might blame me.

747
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:09,375
Bye.

748
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,011
Just kidding.
I came because I was bored.

749
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:13,587
I got the same question I recited to you.

750
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:15,131
-Is it? Nice.
-Yeah it was good.

751
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,291
-How did you write your exam?
-I did well.

752
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:20,666
Hey, dude!

753
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:22,291
What's this? Shall we get out of here?

754
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,392
Do you want to leave? Won't you hit him?

755
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,454
Come. Let me show you my college.

756
00:52:29,654 --> 00:52:30,916
Biryani in our cafeteria tastes great.

757
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:32,833
Hey, Bhanu! How'd you write your exam?

758
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:34,458
Yes!

759
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,541
Filthy dogs!

760
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,250
They tease me every day.

761
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:38,583
Let's go to the cafeteria.

762
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:40,125
There will be people around.

763
00:52:41,184 --> 00:52:43,434
-Hey, Bhanu! How'd you write your exam?
-I did well.

764
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:44,625
Did you, rerally?

765
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:49,070
I want to break their bones.

766
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:52,125
You eat.

767
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,155
Pray for it and it might happen.

768
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:00,750
Where's the rest room?

769
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:04,208
-Go straight and take left.
-OK. I'll just be back.

770
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,416
Hey, your man is electrifying!
Everyone is talking about him.

771
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:12,708
Shut up.

772
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:16,000
No way.
He is a coward. Not gutsy at all.

773
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,708
He wanted to leave when
Naresh was teasing me.

774
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,333
I can get him off my mind now.

775
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,583
What do you mean?

776
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,458
Is it because he didn't put up a fight?

777
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:28,536
Maybe he knows how to handle things.
-Speaking in his defence?

778
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:31,125
I am trying hard to get him off my mind.

779
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,750
He is stuck in there.

780
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:34,541
This excuse is enough for me.

781
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,833
I will delete him from my mind.
The game is over.

782
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:38,147
-Is that your final word?
-Hmm...

783
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:39,750
Hey!

784
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:54,400
Hey! What was the need to touch her?

785
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:55,791
Did you have to

786
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:00,875
Why do you care about that mole?
Like, seriously?

787
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:01,916
You better focus on studies.

788
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,541
Hey, wait.
Pick those papers up.

789
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,500
Pick them up.

790
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,833
-Hey! I said, pick them up.
-Hey, pick them up.

791
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:19,541
It hurts, Sir. Please leave me.

792
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,250
Does it hurt?
Answer this and I will leave you.

793
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:25,125
Why are earth worms and
farmers good friends?

794
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:26,525
They help in the
prevention of soil erosion.

795
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:29,338
They aid in having a
good harvest as well.

796
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,083
Good answer.

797
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,916
Are they spoiling you?

798
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,000
Go and study.

799
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,625
You've got so many moles.

800
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:39,589
Is that why you're so interested, huh?

801
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,475
He took a chance and got doomed.

802
00:54:45,674 --> 00:54:46,615
He's so strong, girl.

803
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:49,708
Hey!

804
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,020
You hit them well.
Were their bones broken?

805
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,833
No! It's not that bad.
They're safe.

806
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,249
What do you eat, man?

807
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:00,625
I have oat meal for breakfast
and then vegetables.

808
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,666
Lots of chicken
or fish in the afternoon...

809
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,678
One reason! God!
Just give me one good reason.

810
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:06,708
Hey.

811
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,217
Stay with me.

812
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:10,958
We came together. So,
let's go back together.

813
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,208
I can't resist anymore.

814
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:15,541
Don't think too much.
I will catch a train.

815
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:18,708
You won't get this chance again.

816
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:20,375
Enjoy the moment happily.

817
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:23,250
Look at your face. It's glowing!

818
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:24,291
Go.

819
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:26,625
Hey!

820
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,541
Wait up...

821
00:55:39,078 --> 00:55:44,119
"Hey, man! What have you done, man?"

822
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,666
"There's chaos in my heart"

823
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:54,883
"Hey, hero!
Stop teasing me, you tough one"

824
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:58,700
"You make my heart feel tingled"

825
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:04,871
"Your heart keeps twirling around"

826
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:10,924
"It feels hurly-burly
no matter what you do"

827
00:56:21,788 --> 00:56:26,829
"Hey, man! What have you done, man?"

828
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:30,912
"There's chaos in my heart"

829
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:37,541
"Hey, hero! Stop teasing me, knotty guy"

830
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:42,125
"You've disturbed all my heart"

831
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:30,913
"Dew drops groove with you"

832
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:35,736
"in the form of drizzling rain"

833
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:41,699
"Heart flows like a cascading stream"

834
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:46,666
"It reminisces your caressing presence"

835
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:55,208
"This rain makes me feel swooned"

836
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:58,166
"I wonder what's happening within"

837
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:07,767
"You never realize the
anxiety inside of you"

838
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:12,875
"I'm all wet with the showers of love"

839
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:29,458
"Hey, man! What's this, man?"

840
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:32,875
"There's confusion in my heart"

841
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:40,125
"Hey, hero! Stop teasing me, knotty guy"

842
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:44,125
"You've disturbed all my heart"

843
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:50,375
"The mishmash in you is filled
with fortunate twirls"

844
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:55,875
"You cannot get it no matter
what you do"

845
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:18,541
Hey, brother-in-law! So good to see you.
How are you?

846
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,083
I missed you a lot.

847
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:22,958
Who's she?

848
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,125
Who's she? She is my uncle's daughter.

849
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,583
Her name is Sailu.
She is from Hyderabad.

850
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:29,500
She is going to come to the US.

851
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,000
OK. Bye.

852
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:35,041
Don't look at them. No... No...

853
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:39,583
Damn!

854
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:46,333
Ramireddy! Go to that side.
Why are you late? Make it fast.

855
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:53,500
Hey, Bhanu! Station master
asked us to come. Shall we go?

856
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:02,708
We will book the
entire compartment beforehand.

857
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,958
We need time to decorate it.

858
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:11,833
Oh! OK.

859
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:41,208
Sister-in-law.

860
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:43,500
Bujji!

861
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:45,208
Ta-da! This is for you.

862
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:48,958
They belong to my mom.
We waited long for this day.

863
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:55,666
All of it for your sister-in-law?
Won't you save some for your wedding?

864
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,583
See you, sister-in-law.

865
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:37,833
What is this, sister?

866
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:39,625
Hari, Isn't it done yet?

867
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,791
-I have no idea how to tie this.
-Uncle! Help him wear it.

868
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:44,875
Thanks, uncle.

869
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,125
[wedding chants]

870
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:21,833
Bujji, come.

871
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,666
Wait, sister-in-law! I'll help you.

872
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,000
Oh! Thank you.

873
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:29,416
Thank you.

874
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,416
Give it here.

875
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,041
Food is served over there.

876
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,166
Yay!

877
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,125
Have more, Ramulamma.

878
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:05,833
Oh!

879
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:08,916
Fritters?

880
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,958
Fritters?
-No! I don't want it.

881
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,458
-Have it, brother-in-law. Please serve.
-No, Bhanu. I don't want it.

882
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,658
Have it, brother-in-law.
I am telling you, right?

883
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,533
-Have it.
-Stop overacting.

884
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,939
Why don't you have it for me.

885
01:03:26,204 --> 01:03:34,733
"All the Goddesses look upon you"

886
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:44,416
"May they guard you with their blessings"

887
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:53,750
"There shall not be tears
or agony in your eyes"

888
01:03:53,958 --> 01:04:02,958
"All your dreams will come true
with their grace"

889
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,500
I wish your mom was alive to see this.

890
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,041
-Do you want this, sis?
-Yeah.

891
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:32,833
Bhanu!

892
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,250
Bhanu!

893
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:38,306
We're packing luggage separately
for the first time.

894
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:40,500
It doesn't feel good.

895
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,458
I don't feel good at all.

896
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,000
Why do you have to go?

897
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,041
Why should girls leave
everything behind and go?

898
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,666
Why don't you ask brother-in-law?
He is a good man.

899
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,958
Try asking him. He might stay back here.

900
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:56,125
Such things exist only in
dreams, not in reality.

901
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,333
Why don't you try asking him?

902
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:02,000
Prince Charming comes on a
horse to take his Princess along.

903
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:03,791
He would't stay back at her palace.
-Shut up.

904
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,375
You try convincing me instead of him.

905
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:10,265
Isn't it tough for you, sister?
Are you not worried?

906
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,437
How will you endure it?

907
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:17,708
Trust!

908
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,291
I trust him.

909
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:25,625
It just happens. We can endure
anything and everything.

910
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:29,041
Ask him to stay back
with that very belief.

911
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:35,000
OK. You can ask your Prince
Charming when it's your time.

912
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:48,083
Will you propose and ask him to stay back?
Is that your plan?

913
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:49,375
Hmm.

914
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:52,750
You'll have your conditions, right?

915
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:56,583
You think it will work out?

916
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,291
He's a doctor in America.
So, think about it.

917
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:07,508
We shouldn't propose first.
They'll take us for granted.

918
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:09,041
They'll get dominative.

919
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:14,875
What if he rejects you?

920
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,830
He cannot reject me.
That's out of question.

921
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:23,791
Hey, Bhanu! Where is my coffee?

922
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,000
It is on the way.

923
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:28,375
The station master called up.
He asked us to come.

924
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,166
OK. Cool.

925
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:31,791
Varun.
-Hi, Bhanu sis...

926
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,833
-Here's your shampoo.
-Thanks.

927
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:37,333
We shall sit together on the train.
Don't go anywhere.

928
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:37,833
OK.

929
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,541
I'll be in the second class coach.

930
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,458
I have to ask you something
and it is very important.

931
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:42,833
OK.

932
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,250
Hey, Bhanu! Come here.

933
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,250
What happened?

934
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:50,408
Nothing.

935
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,158
Don't forget. My coach is S8.

936
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,041
OK.

937
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:00,833
Sister!
-What is it?

938
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,125
She's trying to be smart.

939
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:04,416
She arranged for their
first night on the train.

940
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:05,916
Aren't you ashamed?

941
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:08,583
I didn't do it.
It was Varun's idea and I helped him.

942
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,833
There are auspicious
moments for such things.

943
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:14,083
It can't happen wherever you plan it.
Tell that guy.

944
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,375
Hey! Come here!

945
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,458
You don't have to say it. I will tell him.

946
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:19,125
You go along with your sister in the car.

947
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,583
They will go by train.

948
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:21,416
Let's go.

949
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:22,708
Do you get it?

950
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:27,458
Hey!

951
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:30,000
Take care, dear.

952
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:31,416
OK, then.

953
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:34,833
OK.

954
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:35,791
-Yeah.
-Yes!

955
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,791
We planned to perform rituals at
my uncle's house.

956
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,666
Brother-in-law! I will go by train.

957
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,583
-You guys enjoy.
-Hey!

958
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:12,791
OK. Go.

959
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,458
Why?

960
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,333
She wants to go, right? Let her go.

961
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:21,916
Bye!

962
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:27,375
Bye!

963
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:41,166
Hey, Bhanu! What are you doing here?

964
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,416
Brother-in-law wants privacy.
He asked me to go by train.

965
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,041
Tell me this. Are they
happy together, dear?

966
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,000
Have some water.

967
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:56,708
Sister.

968
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,750
-I don't get it.
-Don't think like an oldie, aunt.

969
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,778
They need to have moments together.

970
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,000
I'll be right back.

971
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:40,958
Bujji.

972
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:46,833
Goodnight.

973
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:49,541
Where is Varun?

974
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,375
He's with Sailu.

975
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:02,708
Sailu! Let me think.

976
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:04,750
Wait. Let me think.

977
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:07,771
Don't worry. I will tell you.

978
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:27,083
Give this to the groom's family.
-OK.

979
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:28,791
-Lemon rice is so good.
-I will go along.

980
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,934
Veeru! Let me come with you. Wait.

981
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:32,083
Come.

982
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:40,000
See.

983
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,125
Dinner, Sir.

984
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:43,208
No.

985
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:44,458
You might feel hungry. Have some.

986
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,583
Are you really hungry, brother-in-law?
We don't want anything.

987
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:47,666
Let's go.

988
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:53,208
Have a banana.

989
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:57,958
What is it?

990
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,958
Bujji didn't have anything.
He might have it.

991
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,015
Sailu! India has nothing to
offer the doctors. Just come.

992
01:11:10,215 --> 01:11:12,416
I will take care of the visa
and university applications.

993
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,102
There's nothing here but lizards,
buffaloes and dirty roads.

994
01:11:16,302 --> 01:11:17,388
It is OK for a vacation.

995
01:11:17,588 --> 01:11:19,137
You can pass time in the
fields on a tractor.

996
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,928
You career is at stakes if you stay here.
I will talk to your family.

997
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:25,250
Trust me. Just come.
Let's plan the wedding later.

998
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,960
-OK?
-OK, brother-in-law.

999
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:29,375
I trust you.

1000
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,625
Love perished even before it bloomed.

1001
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,666
I don't have to look
for any more excuses.

1002
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:07,166
What is it, dear?

1003
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,041
What are you doing here?

1004
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:11,125
Are you missing your sister?

1005
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:13,125
There's nothing like that, dad.
Nothing like that.

1006
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,041
I got you. That is enough for me.

1007
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:21,541
I will stay here with you.

1008
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:24,625
My darling daughter!
You are a sweetheart.

1009
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:26,541
Aren't you dear?

1010
01:12:55,223 --> 01:12:56,223
Greetings.

1011
01:12:58,869 --> 01:12:59,111
Come, dear.

1012
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:00,348
-Give it to me.
-No!

1013
01:13:01,389 --> 01:13:02,264
Go and get it.

1014
01:13:04,889 --> 01:13:05,389
Hey, Bhanu.

1015
01:13:06,139 --> 01:13:07,473
Sister! He is calling you.

1016
01:13:07,598 --> 01:13:08,348
Is everything OK?

1017
01:13:10,021 --> 01:13:13,438
You know you're our guests now, right?
Do you want some coffee, tea or anything?

1018
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:15,389
Hey.

1019
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:22,306
[performing rituals]

1020
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,723
Hey, what happened?
-I'll be right back.

1021
01:13:23,764 --> 01:13:24,848
Where are you going?
-Just a minute.

1022
01:13:30,431 --> 01:13:30,889
Sister.

1023
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:31,973
Bhanu! Are you here?

1024
01:13:32,014 --> 01:13:34,056
We placed our luggage in the
room upstairs. Keep an eye.

1025
01:13:36,806 --> 01:13:37,848
-Lentils broth.
-Fritters.

1026
01:13:39,473 --> 01:13:40,389
Shall I serve lentils broth?

1027
01:13:40,889 --> 01:13:41,514
Will you have it?

1028
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:43,181
Have it.

1029
01:13:44,723 --> 01:13:46,389
-Bhanu! Fritters...
-No! I don't want it.

1030
01:13:47,098 --> 01:13:49,473
-Have it. It will be good.
-I don't want it.

1031
01:13:49,598 --> 01:13:51,348
This is lemon rice.
You call it yellow rice.

1032
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:52,098
Taste it.

1033
01:13:59,098 --> 01:14:01,181
-What happened?
-Serve me a fritter.

1034
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:03,973
That's enough.

1035
01:14:05,848 --> 01:14:07,014
See you, dad.

1036
01:14:08,348 --> 01:14:08,931
Brother-in-law.

1037
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:10,904
Hey! What's up with this?

1038
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:12,056
Bujji.

1039
01:14:14,598 --> 01:14:15,348
Thanks.

1040
01:14:28,723 --> 01:14:29,806
-Dad!
-Dear.

1041
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:31,473
-Take care, dad.
-You too take care, dear.

1042
01:14:31,514 --> 01:14:32,639
See you, aunt.

1043
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,223
-See you, father-in-law.
-Bujji! Bye.

1044
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:40,848
Here. Take your bag.

1045
01:14:45,973 --> 01:14:47,056
Where is Bhanu?

1046
01:14:51,848 --> 01:14:52,723
Ask her to come.

1047
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,389
We're getting late. Let's go.

1048
01:15:20,139 --> 01:15:23,181
"She neither lets me think nor calm down"

1049
01:15:23,264 --> 01:15:26,473
"She neither stays nor leaves"

1050
01:15:26,514 --> 01:15:30,889
"I am bound by captivity"

1051
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:35,889
"I could neither feel anything
nor fall asleep"

1052
01:15:36,056 --> 01:15:39,098
"She neither leaves nor reaches out"

1053
01:15:39,139 --> 01:15:43,598
"I wonder when I'll be free of worry"

1054
01:15:58,014 --> 01:16:00,181
Happy married life, Raja.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

1055
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,431
Thank you.
-How was the wedding?

1056
01:16:01,514 --> 01:16:03,139
He is Ali. Varun's friend.
-How about your journey?

1057
01:16:03,681 --> 01:16:04,348
Hey, kiddo!

1058
01:16:11,306 --> 01:16:14,348
"She neither lets me think nor calm down"

1059
01:16:14,389 --> 01:16:19,056
"She neither stays nor leaves"

1060
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:22,139
"I am bound by captivity"

1061
01:16:23,806 --> 01:16:27,098
"I could neither feel anything
nor fall asleep"

1062
01:16:27,139 --> 01:16:30,223
"She neither leaves nor reaches out"

1063
01:16:30,306 --> 01:16:34,681
"I wonder when I'll be free of worry"

1064
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:08,413
"My life is slipping out of control"

1065
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:12,264
"This suffering is inevitable"

1066
01:17:12,348 --> 01:17:13,473
How was your journey?

1067
01:17:13,556 --> 01:17:15,556
Yeah, dad.
-Sister-in-law! Give that to me.

1068
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:18,764
"Heart's racing to be in your presence"

1069
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:21,098
Did you water my plants?
-Sister-in-law! Is it Bhanu?

1070
01:17:21,389 --> 01:17:22,973
It's good here.
-Give it to me.

1071
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:24,931
I am watering them.
-How's Sumathi doing?

1072
01:17:25,514 --> 01:17:26,348
Sister-in-law.

1073
01:17:31,306 --> 01:17:31,764
Hello.

1074
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:33,514
Bhanu!

1075
01:17:40,514 --> 01:17:43,723
Bhanu! This is the picture of
Narsing Rao's son.

1076
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:45,579
He saw you at the wedding and liked you.

1077
01:17:46,014 --> 01:17:49,098
Her mother wants to know your opinion. It
hasn't been 2 days since ister's wedding.

1078
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:50,389
You are already bothering me.

1079
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:52,931
Send me away. Send me away as well.

1080
01:17:53,723 --> 01:17:56,848
"I can neither endure it nor comprehend"

1081
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:59,889
"I can neither stop nor glide toward you"

1082
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:05,056
"It's a feeling never reminisced"

1083
01:18:06,389 --> 01:18:09,639
"I can neither be in the
moment nor take a chance"

1084
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:12,860
"I can neither live this
dream nor pacify myself"

1085
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:13,223
Hi...

1086
01:18:15,598 --> 01:18:16,598
Next will be your wedding.

1087
01:18:44,836 --> 01:18:50,725
"My life is slipping out of control"

1088
01:18:51,264 --> 01:18:56,348
"This suffering is inevitable"

1089
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:03,544
"Heart's racing to be in your presence"

1090
01:19:04,178 --> 01:19:09,882
"It's a thought that haunts you"

1091
01:19:10,572 --> 01:19:16,437
"Your presence caresses me
even in my sleep"

1092
01:19:17,008 --> 01:19:22,891
"I get forgetful and look for myself"

1093
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:29,197
"The anxiety in my heart
makes me restless"

1094
01:19:29,901 --> 01:19:35,709
"I shall express my feelings
to you someday"

1095
01:19:36,126 --> 01:19:41,961
"Your voice calls out like chasing dreams"

1096
01:19:42,397 --> 01:19:48,353
"That trance has tangled
me like consciousness"

1097
01:19:48,874 --> 01:19:54,721
"The anxiety in my heart
makes me restless"

1098
01:19:55,297 --> 01:20:01,093
"I shall express my feelings
to you someday"

1099
01:20:01,639 --> 01:20:06,556
"Your thoughts never let go of me"

1100
01:20:08,014 --> 01:20:12,556
"Your thoughts never let go of me"

1101
01:20:15,973 --> 01:20:17,556
Sister-in-law! Let me take it.

1102
01:20:19,389 --> 01:20:20,181
What are you making?

1103
01:20:20,231 --> 01:20:22,223
-I am baking a cake. Bujji asked for it.
-Oh!

1104
01:20:22,396 --> 01:20:23,896
Will you have coffee? I will make it.

1105
01:20:23,973 --> 01:20:25,639
-Let me do it. Do you want it?
-OK.

1106
01:20:29,306 --> 01:20:31,088
Sister-in-law! Are you
missing your village?

1107
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,425
Hmm...

1108
01:20:34,223 --> 01:20:36,014
What about Bhanu?

1109
01:20:36,473 --> 01:20:39,514
I miss her a lot. She's a chatterbox.

1110
01:20:40,848 --> 01:20:41,652
She's fiery!

1111
01:20:44,056 --> 01:20:46,681
-It'd be nice if she comes here, right?
-It will be great.

1112
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:49,598
But, how? That won't happen.

1113
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:55,681
Sister-in-law! I actually proposed Bhanu.

1114
01:20:57,306 --> 01:20:57,848
What?

1115
01:20:58,806 --> 01:21:01,806
I proposed Bhanu.
-Did you propose to her?

1116
01:21:02,848 --> 01:21:05,931
-Did you say I love you to her?
-Yes, sister-in-law.

1117
01:21:06,389 --> 01:21:08,598
That's the great news.

1118
01:21:08,723 --> 01:21:12,223
Bhanu will get married and come here.
Why didn't you tell me earlier, Varun?

1119
01:21:15,098 --> 01:21:17,264
Oh! Are you feeling shy?

1120
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,889
I had a doubt on you guys.

1121
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:23,223
But, I didn't know that
you guys are so serious about it.

1122
01:21:23,306 --> 01:21:25,223
You guys look great as a coupe.

1123
01:21:26,806 --> 01:21:27,848
I will call her.

1124
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:29,764
Sister-in-law!
-Where is my phone?

1125
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:31,848
I am waiting for her response.

1126
01:22:02,139 --> 01:22:02,931
Is it Bhanu?

1127
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:13,598
What happened?

1128
01:22:17,389 --> 01:22:19,598
Why don't you say something?
What happened? What did she send?

1129
01:22:26,098 --> 01:22:27,223
What happened, Varun?

1130
01:22:50,889 --> 01:22:54,848
It is my first love and first message
to someone.

1131
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:00,139
I haven't liked anyone as much as her.

1132
01:23:04,348 --> 01:23:06,348
She rejected me and that's clear.

1133
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:12,931
You just wait. I will tell her.
I will talk to her.

1134
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,931
What's this? Are you out of mind?
What do you think of yourself?

1135
01:23:22,056 --> 01:23:26,223
How can hurt him like that?
Think about it. Varun is a nice guy.

1136
01:23:27,139 --> 01:23:29,973
He proposed to me and I responded.
What's wrong with that?

1137
01:23:30,056 --> 01:23:31,806
How can you that you're not interested?

1138
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:33,973
Why did you send a
picture of your footwear?

1139
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:37,223
I am not interested and I just said that.
Do you need clarity?

1140
01:23:37,264 --> 01:23:39,973
Everyone likes him. He is a darling.

1141
01:23:40,264 --> 01:23:42,848
Girls are crazy about him. I know it.

1142
01:23:43,139 --> 01:23:45,972
That's great. Keep supporting him.
He is your brother-in-law, right?

1143
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:48,694
I don't need him.
I am not someone here for time pass.

1144
01:23:48,973 --> 01:23:50,959
Why do you talk about time pass?
That's strange.

1145
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:52,506
My beloved sister!

1146
01:23:52,706 --> 01:23:56,297
Please give it a second thought.
Guys cannot be trusted.

1147
01:23:56,723 --> 01:23:57,732
You're lucky that he likes you.

1148
01:23:57,973 --> 01:24:01,556
I don't want to be that lucky.
I do not like him and that is final.

1149
01:24:03,181 --> 01:24:04,764
Hello? Hello!

1150
01:24:13,473 --> 01:24:14,514
Sister-in-law! What did she say?

1151
01:24:17,014 --> 01:24:19,848
She is crazy. But, you don't worry.

1152
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:21,889
Congratulations on your first love.

1153
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:28,764
Congratulations, my friend.

1154
01:24:31,598 --> 01:24:33,098
Hello! Congratulations.

1155
01:24:33,806 --> 01:24:34,264
Bro!

1156
01:24:38,931 --> 01:24:40,306
Footwear? Why did she send that?

1157
01:24:40,681 --> 01:24:42,473
She kicked my proposal.

1158
01:24:48,139 --> 01:24:49,264
Did she reject you?

1159
01:24:53,431 --> 01:24:55,431
Hey! There are many girls
who are crazy about her.

1160
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:56,723
Forget about her.

1161
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,389
Sister-in-law!
Don't tell anything to brother.

1162
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:08,098
He might feel bad.
There'll be unnecessary mess.

1163
01:25:09,556 --> 01:25:11,306
Hey! Hey, Ali!
Take them all away from here.

1164
01:25:12,181 --> 01:25:13,014
Sister-in-law! Go.

1165
01:25:16,223 --> 01:25:17,848
What's that?
-It is my take-away Biryani.

1166
01:25:21,889 --> 01:25:23,139
Hey! What happened?

1167
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:25,389
Have dinner first and then cake.

1168
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:31,223
What happened to him?
-Nothing. Will you have cake or rice?

1169
01:25:32,264 --> 01:25:33,056
He can't wait.

1170
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:39,931
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. There's nothing.

1171
01:25:58,139 --> 01:25:59,014
Sister-in-law!

1172
01:25:59,556 --> 01:26:00,598
Sister-in-law!

1173
01:26:04,264 --> 01:26:06,848
Sister-in-law she's not ignoring my calls.
Ask her to attend my calls.

1174
01:26:07,639 --> 01:26:09,848
At least she should tell me
what has happened, right?

1175
01:26:10,556 --> 01:26:11,431
I will talk to her.

1176
01:26:13,848 --> 01:26:14,889
[phone buzzes]

1177
01:26:15,014 --> 01:26:17,723
OK. Note down the composition of
zinc-sulphate.

1178
01:26:17,889 --> 01:26:18,681
Hello, Bhanu.

1179
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:23,723
Please don't do that.
Talk to him for once at least for my sake.

1180
01:26:24,056 --> 01:26:25,181
My dear, listen!

1181
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:28,681
He is your brother-in-law's brother.
How can you do that to him?

1182
01:26:28,889 --> 01:26:31,306
OK! Stop it. I will talk to him.

1183
01:26:31,473 --> 01:26:32,973
Talk to him now. Call him.

1184
01:26:35,431 --> 01:26:37,306
Bhanu? Bhanu.

1185
01:26:39,514 --> 01:26:40,639
Bhanu, are you crazy?

1186
01:26:40,931 --> 01:26:44,181
Are you out of your mind?
Why do have such an ego?

1187
01:26:44,473 --> 01:26:46,098
Hey! At least pick my God damn phone.

1188
01:26:46,556 --> 01:26:48,264
Hello, Bhanu. Bhanu?

1189
01:26:48,556 --> 01:26:50,514
Don't shout. Tell me.

1190
01:26:50,723 --> 01:26:52,598
Shouting? Am I shouting?

1191
01:26:53,473 --> 01:26:54,806
Do you know what you've done?

1192
01:26:56,139 --> 01:26:57,264
Why? Tell me. Why?

1193
01:26:57,514 --> 01:26:59,723
I don't like you, Varun.
That is the reason. Is that OK?

1194
01:27:06,431 --> 01:27:08,431
Varun! Varun?

1195
01:27:09,389 --> 01:27:09,806
Varun.

1196
01:27:12,223 --> 01:27:12,556
Varun.

1197
01:27:15,389 --> 01:27:17,264
It has been many days
that you called me like that.

1198
01:27:20,223 --> 01:27:21,431
I don't like you.

1199
01:27:23,473 --> 01:27:23,973
Why?

1200
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:26,264
There is no reason.

1201
01:27:28,723 --> 01:27:31,056
I don't believe this.
It is not acceptable.

1202
01:27:31,348 --> 01:27:32,264
You like me.

1203
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:33,639
I could sense it.

1204
01:27:34,598 --> 01:27:37,181
We had moments, Bhanu.
That day in your room.

1205
01:27:37,723 --> 01:27:38,681
What happened suddenly?

1206
01:27:38,889 --> 01:27:42,014
-See you. I have to attend my class.
-Class? Useless class.

1207
01:27:42,348 --> 01:27:43,913
It is my life.It is my freaking life.

1208
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:45,473
What do you think about me?

1209
01:27:45,764 --> 01:27:47,025
I am a doctor from
one of the tops schools in America.

1210
01:27:47,473 --> 01:27:48,973
Millions! I earn millions.

1211
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:52,973
You are simply a village
girl who does farming.

1212
01:27:53,848 --> 01:27:54,056
Huh?

1213
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:56,556
Average! No, you are below average girl.

1214
01:27:58,223 --> 01:27:59,014
Are you dizzy?

1215
01:27:59,306 --> 01:28:00,681
Do you know what you're doing?

1216
01:28:00,931 --> 01:28:03,098
What should I do with the
picture of your footwear?

1217
01:28:04,223 --> 01:28:05,556
Can you find a person like me?

1218
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:07,764
Can you find anyone
who could match my range?

1219
01:28:09,389 --> 01:28:11,556
Bhanu? Bhanu, are you there?

1220
01:28:11,598 --> 01:28:13,181
Hello? Bhanu.

1221
01:28:13,514 --> 01:28:14,056
Hello!

1222
01:28:14,264 --> 01:28:18,306
My class is useless,
my tractor is useless,

1223
01:28:19,306 --> 01:28:22,389
And I am an average girl.
Sorry. I am below average. Is that right?

1224
01:28:23,098 --> 01:28:23,806
Is that what you said?

1225
01:28:25,223 --> 01:28:28,473
Forget about someone
who could match your range.

1226
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:31,681
I will find a much better person
than you very easily. Wait and see.

1227
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,931
-Bhanu.
-OK. Bye.

1228
01:28:35,431 --> 01:28:36,556
Hello. Bhanu!

1229
01:28:38,389 --> 01:28:39,139
Oh, God!

1230
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,181
Can you find a person like me?

1231
01:28:51,514 --> 01:28:53,473
Can you find anyone
who could match my range?

1232
01:28:57,889 --> 01:28:59,431
-Have we received the email?
-No, Sir.

1233
01:29:00,598 --> 01:29:02,931
-Hey! Call my mom.
-No! I came for you.

1234
01:29:04,014 --> 01:29:05,431
-We will meet you later, Sir.
-OK.

1235
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:06,723
-We'll meet tomorrow.
-Yeah. OK.

1236
01:29:06,764 --> 01:29:07,889
Yeah. Thank you.

1237
01:29:07,931 --> 01:29:08,639
See you, Sir.

1238
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:09,806
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

1239
01:29:09,848 --> 01:29:11,973
-I am Bhanu. I stay nearby.
-Yeah. I know!

1240
01:29:15,431 --> 01:29:16,764
Can I take a selfie with you?

1241
01:29:17,931 --> 01:29:20,223
-You did your studies from London, right?
-Yes.

1242
01:29:20,264 --> 01:29:22,764
You studied there but
started your business here in our village.

1243
01:29:22,806 --> 01:29:23,806
Yeah. Farmer!

1244
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:24,848
You're so great.

1245
01:29:26,014 --> 01:29:27,598
That is why I want a selfie with you.

1246
01:29:27,723 --> 01:29:28,223
OK.

1247
01:29:29,473 --> 01:29:30,306
Thank you.

1248
01:29:30,931 --> 01:29:32,514
Left or right? OK.

1249
01:29:39,514 --> 01:29:42,098
-What is Bhanu doing here?
-Hey! Why do you care?

1250
01:29:42,848 --> 01:29:45,473
-Say it, bro.
-Who's that? She is Bhanu, right?

1251
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:49,389
Mom! She says that I am great. So,
she came here to take a selfie with me.

1252
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:51,181
-Oh! Selfie?
-Oh!

1253
01:29:59,431 --> 01:30:02,681
You have to get up early at 3 am.
That's a tradition.

1254
01:30:03,056 --> 01:30:05,348
You have to bath with cold water.
Can guys living in America do it?'

1255
01:30:17,514 --> 01:30:19,264
Sister-in-law!
Is Bhanu really your sister?

1256
01:30:20,223 --> 01:30:21,223
What happened?

1257
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,556
She is so violent, sister-in-law.
She's made me violent as well.

1258
01:30:30,556 --> 01:30:33,848
Varun! Please don't feel bad.

1259
01:30:34,264 --> 01:30:36,181
She's like that.
You know about her, right?

1260
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:40,139
Don't be sad. It does not feel good here.

1261
01:30:42,723 --> 01:30:44,889
She is crazy. She's always at pace.

1262
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:47,139
She understands it slowly.

1263
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:48,806
I will talk to her.

1264
01:30:49,598 --> 01:30:50,806
There should be some
limit to her craziness.

1265
01:30:51,223 --> 01:30:53,056
She does not have any limits.
She is just crazy.

1266
01:30:53,306 --> 01:30:54,514
She tortures me, sister-in-law.

1267
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:02,556
Oh, shit!

1268
01:31:03,389 --> 01:31:06,514
Hi, sister-in-law!
Here are your curry leaves and vegetables.

1269
01:31:07,639 --> 01:31:09,639
I took an appointment for driving classes.
Get ready.

1270
01:31:10,473 --> 01:31:11,306
Will you have crepe?

1271
01:31:12,598 --> 01:31:13,973
Did he eat?
-No.

1272
01:31:14,389 --> 01:31:15,181
I will have crepes.

1273
01:31:23,223 --> 01:31:24,473
What is it?
Did you get a picture of footwear?

1274
01:31:25,473 --> 01:31:26,431
Who is he?

1275
01:31:26,806 --> 01:31:29,014
Cry! Simply cry.

1276
01:31:29,181 --> 01:31:31,514
Become a slave of her heart!
Shall I get a drink and a pet?

1277
01:31:36,764 --> 01:31:38,681
That's curry leaf.
You are just that for her.

1278
01:31:39,348 --> 01:31:43,098
She's a village girl.
She found a guy so easily.

1279
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,806
You are in America but there is no use.

1280
01:31:46,598 --> 01:31:49,181
It is a shame to Americans.
Trump might feel bad.

1281
01:31:50,056 --> 01:31:51,264
She cannot understand, dude.

1282
01:31:52,889 --> 01:31:53,556
Call up Suzie.

1283
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,223
See this. See it clearly.

1284
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,181
She took a close selfie with him.
Call her.

1285
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:04,723
Are you sure?

1286
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:08,264
I am not asking you to love her.
Send her a picture with Suzie.

1287
01:32:08,306 --> 01:32:08,639
OK.

1288
01:32:14,973 --> 01:32:17,389
Hey, Suz! How are you doing?

1289
01:32:19,973 --> 01:32:21,139
Do you want to catch up tonight?

1290
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:24,556
Oh! This looks so good.

1291
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:26,973
Thanks for calling me.
So, let me tell a little about myself.

1292
01:32:27,014 --> 01:32:29,514
My mom is from Hungary and
my dad is from Slovakia.

1293
01:32:29,973 --> 01:32:35,337
Two lovers watching favorite star's movie.
That's an awesome scene!

1294
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:43,639
I had a really good time.

1295
01:32:43,848 --> 01:32:45,889
-Yeah me too. Thanks for everything Varun.
-Yeah.

1296
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:55,723
Do you have such girlfriends
with whom you had fun with?

1297
01:32:59,931 --> 01:33:02,556
Couldn't you even kiss her?
You couldn't kiss Suzie.

1298
01:33:07,639 --> 01:33:10,098
Your love is true. But,
that crazy girl cannot understand that.

1299
01:33:11,098 --> 01:33:13,556
I am totally impressed.
I can't take her out of my mind.

1300
01:33:14,139 --> 01:33:17,639
We dream to live with someone for life.
She's that woman.

1301
01:33:18,264 --> 01:33:18,973
She's the one.

1302
01:33:21,139 --> 01:33:22,098
Every day will be new.

1303
01:33:24,139 --> 01:33:26,973
No one knows what she is up to and
it is not so easy to understand her.

1304
01:33:27,223 --> 01:33:28,098
It is like a thriller story.

1305
01:33:29,223 --> 01:33:31,223
That isn't a thriller story
but a horror story.

1306
01:33:31,598 --> 01:33:33,056
-You cannot rely on her.
-Hey!

1307
01:33:40,306 --> 01:33:41,473
Hello.
-Hello.

1308
01:33:42,014 --> 01:33:42,639
Hello. Who is it?

1309
01:33:43,056 --> 01:33:44,681
This is Ali from America.

1310
01:33:46,514 --> 01:33:47,764
Your sister is my sister-in-law as well.

1311
01:33:48,973 --> 01:33:50,348
I don't believe that you are her sister.

1312
01:33:51,431 --> 01:33:52,598
You are torturing him.

1313
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:54,214
Do you think he has no one?

1314
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:58,056
There are many girls
who are ready to kiss him.

1315
01:33:58,264 --> 01:34:00,806
Is it? Call up someone from
Guinness world records.

1316
01:34:01,056 --> 01:34:02,473
Why are you calling me?

1317
01:34:03,806 --> 01:34:05,639
What? Guinness world records?

1318
01:34:07,556 --> 01:34:08,931
This is definitely a horror story.

1319
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:13,306
Let me show her.

1320
01:34:14,598 --> 01:34:15,598
Let us take a selfie.

1321
01:34:17,473 --> 01:34:19,723
Let this Saturday be an occasion for us.

1322
01:34:19,973 --> 01:34:21,098
It is just a small celebration. OK.

1323
01:34:23,598 --> 01:34:25,431
Close your eyes.
-Why should I close my eyes?

1324
01:34:25,556 --> 01:34:26,348
Do what I say.

1325
01:34:34,306 --> 01:34:35,139
Mom! She is here.

1326
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:37,764
Hey, Bhanu.

1327
01:34:38,556 --> 01:34:39,431
She is Bhanu.

1328
01:34:39,931 --> 01:34:40,389
Hi.

1329
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:43,889
They're family of Narsing Rao.

1330
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:45,014
They came for you.

1331
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:48,639
Did you take a selfie with that guy?

1332
01:34:56,389 --> 01:34:58,764
I just took a selfie.
Why should I marry for that?

1333
01:34:58,973 --> 01:35:00,098
What is this?

1334
01:35:01,598 --> 01:35:03,264
Kill me. Crazy!

1335
01:35:04,306 --> 01:35:06,473
You want to stay with your dad, right?

1336
01:35:07,056 --> 01:35:08,431
They live close by.

1337
01:35:08,848 --> 01:35:10,139
What else do you need?

1338
01:35:10,473 --> 01:35:12,181
That guy is handsome.

1339
01:35:12,431 --> 01:35:14,139
Hey! I do not like it.

1340
01:35:14,514 --> 01:35:16,389
Who is he, sister-in-law?
Who is he?

1341
01:35:18,223 --> 01:35:21,848
Aunt talked about a match.
He must be the one.

1342
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:23,931
They liked her.

1343
01:35:25,098 --> 01:35:27,556
Did she get ready for the wedding?
So soon?

1344
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,723
There's nothing like that. She should
be ready for the wedding, right?

1345
01:35:31,473 --> 01:35:34,139
You know about her. She is crazy.

1346
01:35:34,806 --> 01:35:35,889
Don't worry.

1347
01:35:40,431 --> 01:35:42,473
Varun! Are you fine?

1348
01:35:44,223 --> 01:35:45,139
You go and sleep, sister-in-law.

1349
01:35:46,139 --> 01:35:46,723
Sorry.

1350
01:35:53,306 --> 01:35:53,764
Varun!

1351
01:35:55,181 --> 01:35:57,056
You do not sleep properly.

1352
01:35:58,598 --> 01:36:00,098
I am unable to sleep, sister-in-law.

1353
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:08,514
You sleep, sister-in-law. Goodnight.

1354
01:36:08,598 --> 01:36:10,306
Sorry. Goodnight.

1355
01:36:29,973 --> 01:36:30,723
Aunt!

1356
01:36:32,973 --> 01:36:33,389
Hello.

1357
01:36:33,431 --> 01:36:35,139
Bhanu's match got fixed, dear.

1358
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:35,723
Is it?

1359
01:36:35,973 --> 01:36:37,598
Hey! It seems Bhanu's match is fixed.

1360
01:36:38,181 --> 01:36:40,848
That's good to know, father-in-law.
What does the groom do?

1361
01:36:41,139 --> 01:36:42,848
He studied in London, dear.

1362
01:36:44,973 --> 01:36:46,639
This is a very good match, dear.

1363
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:47,764
Yeah, dad.

1364
01:36:47,973 --> 01:36:49,681
Your sister's wedding is confirmed, dear.

1365
01:36:49,931 --> 01:36:51,098
Hand over the phone to her.

1366
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:53,181
Here. Your sister is on call.

1367
01:36:54,514 --> 01:36:57,598
What's this? Have you gone crazy?

1368
01:36:58,348 --> 01:37:00,014
Do you know what you're doing?

1369
01:37:01,264 --> 01:37:02,973
Why are you so hasty?

1370
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:04,598
Do you really like him?

1371
01:37:07,806 --> 01:37:09,639
Don't be foolish, Bhanu.

1372
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:13,264
Listen to me, my darling.

1373
01:37:13,306 --> 01:37:14,098
Sister!

1374
01:37:14,431 --> 01:37:16,889
I asked what something that
you like about brother-in-law is.

1375
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:17,889
Do you remember?

1376
01:37:18,931 --> 01:37:21,014
Why are you talking about that now?
Let me say it.

1377
01:37:22,081 --> 01:37:23,098
You talked about trust.

1378
01:37:23,856 --> 01:37:25,598
I do not trust your brother-in-law.

1379
01:37:28,231 --> 01:37:30,264
Hello? Bhanu!

1380
01:37:41,764 --> 01:37:43,223
-Mr. Raju.
-Yeah.

1381
01:37:43,681 --> 01:37:44,764
Mrs. Raju.

1382
01:37:45,264 --> 01:37:47,598
Congratulations!
You are going to be parents.

1383
01:37:47,723 --> 01:37:48,306
Wow!

1384
01:37:50,556 --> 01:37:51,723
Thank you so much.

1385
01:37:54,223 --> 01:37:54,598
Come.

1386
01:37:57,264 --> 01:37:58,598
I am so happy.
-You come with me.

1387
01:37:59,764 --> 01:38:01,139
Make sure to take care of everything.

1388
01:38:01,181 --> 01:38:04,014
Hey, Varun! I will get the car.
You guys come down.

1389
01:38:04,764 --> 01:38:05,348
Just wait.

1390
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:09,264
Be sure to watch her food
you should be very careful.

1391
01:38:09,514 --> 01:38:11,681
Make sure she has a very good diet.

1392
01:38:22,223 --> 01:38:23,431
Hey, doctor.
-Hello.

1393
01:38:29,792 --> 01:38:30,521
Sister-in-law!

1394
01:38:35,581 --> 01:38:36,973
What happened, sister-in-law?

1395
01:38:38,931 --> 01:38:40,223
Forget about Bhanu, Varun.

1396
01:38:41,306 --> 01:38:44,139
She is not so special.
She is not as special as you.

1397
01:38:45,473 --> 01:38:48,264
It will be good to be
with her for a few days.

1398
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:51,848
But, she is stubborn and crazy.
You know it, right?

1399
01:38:53,389 --> 01:38:55,723
She is not so beautiful as well.

1400
01:38:58,014 --> 01:39:02,806
She had relations with
many at her college.

1401
01:39:03,639 --> 01:39:04,806
Sister-in-law! You are lying.

1402
01:39:07,223 --> 01:39:08,556
What else should I do, Varun?

1403
01:39:10,181 --> 01:39:12,014
I cannot see you like this.
What should I do?

1404
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:16,268
I tried to convince her but
she doesn't listen to me.

1405
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,014
She does what she wants.

1406
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:19,681
You are worried about her.

1407
01:39:21,014 --> 01:39:22,848
She agreed to get married.

1408
01:39:23,806 --> 01:39:24,556
Marriage?

1409
01:39:25,389 --> 01:39:27,848
-Dad told me.
-Oh, Shit.

1410
01:39:29,473 --> 01:39:32,514
You are getting worried and
spoiling your mind.

1411
01:39:35,139 --> 01:39:37,264
You don't eat or sleep well.

1412
01:39:37,598 --> 01:39:38,931
Tell me what I should do.

1413
01:39:39,639 --> 01:39:41,348
Let it be, sister-in-law.

1414
01:39:42,723 --> 01:39:45,598
She's out from and my mind and
my heart from this moment.

1415
01:39:46,889 --> 01:39:51,764
You wept for me and
made her low before me.

1416
01:39:52,514 --> 01:39:53,473
Can't I forget her?

1417
01:39:54,431 --> 01:39:56,389
I can forget her easily, sister-in-law.

1418
01:39:56,431 --> 01:39:59,889
We have you and there'll be a baby.
That is enough.

1419
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:01,889
I'll be happy.

1420
01:40:02,431 --> 01:40:03,973
Don't worry about me, sister-in-law.

1421
01:40:04,431 --> 01:40:06,348
Take rest. Don't think about anything.

1422
01:40:06,848 --> 01:40:07,264
OK.

01:40:15,056 --> 01:40:15,931
I am so happy.

1426

Everything good happens to us.

01:41:15,264 --> 01:41:17,014
OK. We'll take from the left side.

1440
01:41:18,556 --> 01:41:19,348
Thank you.

1441
01:41:21,014 --> 01:41:22,681
What happened, Bhanu?
Where are you going?

1442
01:41:27,473 --> 01:41:29,431
What is it? Why did you walk away?

1443
01:41:34,223 --> 01:41:35,355
There is no chemistry between us.

1444
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:37,295
Chemistry? What do you mean by that?

1445
01:41:37,764 --> 01:41:39,056
He held my waist.

1446
01:41:40,889 --> 01:41:41,556
I didn't like it.

1447
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:44,473
There should be some feeling, right?

1448
01:41:44,931 --> 01:41:47,389
-I have to get impressed.
-You can feel it after getting married.

1449
01:41:47,598 --> 01:41:48,306
What if that doesn't happen?

1450
01:41:48,556 --> 01:41:52,639
How can you get impressed with
just one touch and start enjoying?

1451
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:54,556
Stop it. Don't have such expectations.

1452
01:41:54,848 --> 01:41:57,056
They're not just expectations.
It is way beyond that.

1453
01:41:57,223 --> 01:42:01,973
You silly! Everyone talks like that
but they get married.

1454
01:42:02,056 --> 01:42:04,431
I am telling you, it feels like that.

1455
01:42:32,473 --> 01:42:33,348
Bloody idiot!

1456
01:42:34,764 --> 01:42:38,306
You went back to America and
you enjoying with girls.

1457
01:42:39,389 --> 01:42:42,389
I am feeling that torture. Damn!

1458
01:43:02,514 --> 01:43:04,389
Yeah. Are you feeling pain here?
-Yeah.

1459
01:43:04,723 --> 01:43:06,723
Yeah, Sir. See this on the scan.

1460
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:08,431
You need to take some bed rest.

1461
01:43:11,848 --> 01:43:14,389
Bhanu dear!
-What is it, dad?

1462
01:43:18,973 --> 01:43:21,389
Your sister needs bed rest for 3 months.

1463
01:43:22,556 --> 01:43:23,931
She should take proper care.

1464
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:26,514
Raju is worried.

1465
01:43:27,014 --> 01:43:28,348
He asked me to send your aunt.

1466
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:34,181
I want you to go there, dear.

1467
01:43:34,598 --> 01:43:35,306
Will you go?

1468
01:43:35,848 --> 01:43:36,348
Me?

1469
01:43:37,389 --> 01:43:38,264
Should I go to America?

1470
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:44,598
I cannot go to America, dad.

1471
01:43:45,223 --> 01:43:47,264
Leave it. Let aunt go.

1472
01:43:47,556 --> 01:43:51,723
She can't go. She will not be comfortable
with the flight journey.

1473
01:43:52,931 --> 01:43:54,389
It will be nice if you go.

1474
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:57,848
You cannot understand, dad. I can't go.

1475
01:43:59,806 --> 01:44:01,389
You say that you are everything to me.

1476
01:44:01,681 --> 01:44:02,848
Try to be her mother.

1477
01:44:04,473 --> 01:44:06,056
Mom would've done it.

1478
01:44:08,098 --> 01:44:09,681
She's all alone there, dear.

1479
01:44:18,223 --> 01:44:19,098
Don't worry.

1480
01:44:19,514 --> 01:44:21,848
Nothing will happen if even she comes.
Be strong.

1481
01:44:22,181 --> 01:44:24,264
I am there with you. Shave your beard.

1482
01:44:24,764 --> 01:44:26,681
Try to look good.
-OK.

1483
01:44:26,764 --> 01:44:27,931
Suzie is your girlfriend.

1484
01:44:28,056 --> 01:44:31,306
She is your girlfriend and it should
be shown that way. Do you get it?

1485
01:44:31,389 --> 01:44:33,098
She sent a picture of her footwear, right?

1486
01:44:33,764 --> 01:44:34,598
Keep it with you.

1487
01:44:34,848 --> 01:44:36,806
I can give another symbolic representation
that you're nothing.

1488
01:44:36,889 --> 01:44:38,223
Mark my words!

1489
01:44:38,514 --> 01:44:39,223
Be strong.

1490
01:44:54,848 --> 01:44:56,973
It is just me. Bhanumati! All in one.

1491
01:44:57,348 --> 01:44:59,556
You might've never seen a girl like me
who works hard.

1492
01:44:59,681 --> 01:45:03,764
You saw girls who work in AC rooms
with several gadgets.

1493
01:45:10,514 --> 01:45:11,389
Hey! How are you?

1494
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,139
I am good. How about you?

1495
01:45:13,806 --> 01:45:15,264
I am good. I am actually happy.

1496
01:45:18,306 --> 01:45:19,556
You look strange.

1497
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:21,223
Ah?

1498
01:45:22,723 --> 01:45:24,723
Braided hair is not suitable
while wearing jeans.

1499
01:45:25,181 --> 01:45:27,723
It is not good.
-They will not arrest me for that.

1500
01:45:39,206 --> 01:45:40,681
-Hey, Suz!
-Hey!

1501
01:45:40,889 --> 01:45:41,473
That's Bhanu.

1502
01:45:41,556 --> 01:45:43,139
Hi, I am Suzie.
-Hi, I am Bhanu.

1503
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:43,889
Nice to meet you.

1504
01:45:43,931 --> 01:45:45,764
Hey! Could you open the trunk?
-Yeah. Absolutely.

1505
01:45:50,556 --> 01:45:53,389
Bhanu! That is Suzie. She's my girlfriend.

1506
01:45:55,723 --> 01:45:56,764
She is my girlfriend.

1507
01:45:57,473 --> 01:45:57,889
Oh!

1508
01:46:01,264 --> 01:46:03,473
So, awesome! How'd you like it?
Will you have palm shoots?

1509
01:46:05,098 --> 01:46:05,556
No. Thanks.

1510
01:46:05,598 --> 01:46:07,014
You told my aunt that you like them,
right?

1511
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:09,223
She asked me to give you.
That is why I offered.

1512
01:46:10,723 --> 01:46:13,098
Do you want to eat?
-Oh! Yeah. Sure.

1513
01:46:15,639 --> 01:46:17,348
Yeah. It is interesting.
-That's fibre.

1514
01:46:17,514 --> 01:46:19,389
Yeah. Thank you.
-They don't allow it. How did you get it?

1515
01:46:20,223 --> 01:46:21,473
Nothing will happen to this place.

1516
01:46:25,264 --> 01:46:25,556
Hey.

1517
01:46:28,681 --> 01:46:29,764
You denied already.
-Give.

1518
01:46:41,014 --> 01:46:43,098
Bujji.
-Yeah. You are finally here, Bhanu.

1519
01:46:43,139 --> 01:46:44,431
Suzie!
-Hi. How are you?

1520
01:46:44,473 --> 01:46:44,973
I am good.

1521
01:46:45,848 --> 01:46:47,181
Alright, Suz.
-Bye.

1522
01:46:47,306 --> 01:46:48,889
Bye. See you tomorrow.
-OK, Bye.

1523
01:46:48,931 --> 01:46:50,348
Take care. Bye.
-Bye! Thank you.

1524
01:46:50,389 --> 01:46:52,473
Oh! Bye. No problem. See you later.

1525
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:56,681
By the way, I really like your style.
The braid, the bindi, and jeans!

1526
01:46:56,931 --> 01:46:59,348
It really suits you.
-Hey, Suz! Aren't you getting late?

1527
01:46:59,389 --> 01:47:00,431
-OK. See you later.
-Bye!

1528
01:47:00,514 --> 01:47:01,264
Yeah. Bye!

1529
01:47:02,306 --> 01:47:03,056
Brother-in-law!
-Hey, Bhanu!

1530
01:47:03,139 --> 01:47:04,681
How are you?
-I am good. How are you?

1531
01:47:04,764 --> 01:47:06,389
I am good. Where is sister?
-She's over there.

1532
01:47:06,806 --> 01:47:08,889
Hey, Ali! What are you doing here?
-Raju asked me to get Biryani.

1533
01:47:09,264 --> 01:47:11,014
Moreover, I am excited to see this girl.

1534
01:47:11,431 --> 01:47:12,473
Did she get shocked looking at Suzie?

1535
01:47:12,889 --> 01:47:14,514
She is a village girl but looks good.

1536
01:47:15,681 --> 01:47:16,514
She's average.

1537
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:19,514
Listen! Maintain your attitude.
I'll be there for you.

1538
01:47:19,764 --> 01:47:20,681
OK. Let's go.

1539
01:47:27,889 --> 01:47:29,473
How are you?
-I am good.

1540
01:47:29,556 --> 01:47:30,306
How's the baby?

1541
01:47:30,389 --> 01:47:32,014
I placed your luggage in
the room upstairs. OK?

1542
01:47:32,806 --> 01:47:34,181
Hey! I got something for you. Wait.

1543
01:47:34,223 --> 01:47:36,973
Hey, wait. Freshen up and
eat something.

1544
01:47:37,764 --> 01:47:39,514
Bujji! This is for you.

1545
01:47:50,098 --> 01:47:52,098
Sister! These are for both of you.
-What is this?

1546
01:47:54,431 --> 01:47:55,056
This is for you.

1547
01:47:59,514 --> 01:48:02,431
Its OK. No need for that.
I don't want any gift.

1548
01:48:02,514 --> 01:48:03,014
Its OK.

1549
01:48:06,139 --> 01:48:06,973
Try it like this.

1550
01:48:10,348 --> 01:48:13,014
You own a restaurant, right?
Place this at the counter.

1551
01:48:13,264 --> 01:48:15,556
Look at it whenever you are stressed
and you'll feel good.

1552
01:48:15,848 --> 01:48:17,014
You will be calm.

1553
01:48:17,556 --> 01:48:18,306
Stress?

1554
01:48:20,264 --> 01:48:23,431
You are the first one
who worried about my stress, Bhanu.

1555
01:48:23,931 --> 01:48:25,431
Great. Thank you.

1556
01:48:26,139 --> 01:48:27,514
I will be there for you in America.

1557
01:48:28,139 --> 01:48:30,473
Our friendship will be there lifelong.
I am there for you.

1558
01:48:31,264 --> 01:48:33,348
Sister-in-law! Your sister is amazing.

1559
01:48:43,014 --> 01:48:45,139
Hey, Varun! She has a point.

1560
01:48:45,681 --> 01:48:48,014
She didn't like you and
that is what she said. It is fair.

1561
01:48:48,473 --> 01:48:50,389
You better be with Suzie. That's it.
-Hey!

1562
01:48:50,681 --> 01:48:53,764
But, there is something about her.
I am impressed within moments.

1563
01:48:54,056 --> 01:48:56,539
You are in love with her. I can
understand that it is hard to forget her.

1564
01:48:57,014 --> 01:48:58,959
I pity you. I feel you. I get you, bro.

1565
01:48:59,598 --> 01:49:01,598
Why should I care about what you feel,
you idiot?

1566
01:49:01,681 --> 01:49:04,098
You're my friend. You are my freaking
friend. You have to support me.

1567
01:49:04,348 --> 01:49:06,306
Don't you understand my suffering?

1568
01:49:08,139 --> 01:49:09,556
Hey, Varun! You got Suzie.
-Hey!

1569
01:49:09,889 --> 01:49:10,181
Shit.

1570
01:49:10,223 --> 01:49:11,348
But, I promised her, dude.

1571
01:49:11,514 --> 01:49:12,639
Sister, look what he's doing.

1572
01:49:12,764 --> 01:49:16,098
Hey! Give these pills before
breakfast and these after breakfast.

1573
01:49:16,431 --> 01:49:19,139
Give these after lunch and
these pills after dinner.

1574
01:49:21,514 --> 01:49:22,889
Sister-in-law! Your food is ready.

1575
01:49:23,431 --> 01:49:24,264
Won'tyou eat?

1576
01:49:25,306 --> 01:49:28,389
No, sister-in-law. I will have it later.
I have to study. You guys have it.

1577
01:49:31,723 --> 01:49:32,681
Did you reach safely?

1578
01:49:33,181 --> 01:49:36,473
What's the time there?
-It is 11 pm. Did you take medicine?

1579
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,639
Who will give me when you're away.
-Dad!

1580
01:49:40,223 --> 01:49:41,264
I took them, dear.

1581
01:49:41,889 --> 01:49:44,389
Bhanu dear! I am missing you guys.

1582
01:49:45,098 --> 01:49:46,389
Both of you aren't with me.

1583
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:49,889
You are the one who sent me.
I feel the same.

1584
01:49:49,973 --> 01:49:51,889
It is getting for you. Sleep.

1585
01:49:54,098 --> 01:49:55,223
OK, dad.

1586
01:50:49,404 --> 01:50:51,223
Bhanu. Hey!

1587
01:50:56,014 --> 01:50:56,931
I will show you the kitchen.

1588
01:51:03,889 --> 01:51:05,639
Milk and juices will be inside this.

1589
01:51:06,681 --> 01:51:08,806
Coffee cups and powders
are in this cupboard.

1590
01:51:09,598 --> 01:51:12,014
This is the grinder and
this is a coffee machine.

1591
01:51:12,889 --> 01:51:15,139
-That is jet lag, Bhanu. Nothing serious.
-I know.

1592
01:51:16,806 --> 01:51:19,598
This is dishwasher and that is a toaster.

1593
01:51:22,098 --> 01:51:22,889
Where is my gift?

1594
01:51:24,723 --> 01:51:27,098
You got something for me, right?
-You denied taking it.

1595
01:51:40,764 --> 01:51:41,598
Man!

1596
01:51:47,764 --> 01:51:48,181
Why?

1597
01:51:48,598 --> 01:51:50,348
Bloody shameless bugger. Is it needed?

1598
01:51:52,681 --> 01:51:53,473
O' God!

1599
01:52:16,681 --> 01:52:18,598
You sit in the front seat, Bhanu.

1600
01:52:28,431 --> 01:52:29,764
Bye, Bhanu.

1601
01:52:30,223 --> 01:52:30,889
Thank you.

1602
01:53:04,889 --> 01:53:07,056
Hey, no problem. I will clean my room.

1603
01:53:44,723 --> 01:53:45,931
It looks good on you.

1604
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:51,931

1605
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:03,723
Come on, dance.

1606
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:18,264
"He's here. He came with a low pace"

1607
01:54:18,306 --> 01:54:20,514
"He tricked with a lovely trap"

1608
01:54:20,598 --> 01:54:25,098
"He won't let you be calm and be steady"

1609
01:54:25,181 --> 01:54:29,764
"He gave a smile that
led to sleeplessness"

1610
01:54:30,889 --> 01:54:33,848
Kids! Just keep it a little low.

1611
01:54:34,931 --> 01:54:36,764
This is America. Not Banswada.

1612
01:54:44,139 --> 01:54:46,306
You enjoyed
when I danced back in Banswada.

1613
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:50,056
You were good back then.
But, you're bad now.

1614
01:55:03,056 --> 01:55:04,306
Yeah. It's turkey time.

1615
01:55:04,556 --> 01:55:06,931
Yeah. The turkey is ready.
-The turkey is ready.

1616
01:55:07,556 --> 01:55:08,596
The turkey is here.

1617
01:55:08,723 --> 01:55:10,764
What's so special about it?
It is like a broiler chicken.

1618
01:55:10,806 --> 01:55:12,806
What? Broiler chicken?

1619
01:55:19,139 --> 01:55:19,889
Wow!

1620
01:55:20,681 --> 01:55:22,473
That's Suzie. You can go ahead
for a committed relationship.

1621
01:55:23,348 --> 01:55:24,639
Wow! You look stunning.

1622
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:25,973
-Thank you so much.
-You're so beautiful.

1623
01:55:26,056 --> 01:55:27,931
Thank you. It was all her.

1624
01:55:28,098 --> 01:55:31,806
No. Hey! I just figured
that you can carry any dress very well.

1625
01:55:32,014 --> 01:55:34,764
-But, she can't carry yours.
-Varun! That is not true.

1626
01:55:34,806 --> 01:55:36,223
She would do so beautifully.

1627
01:55:36,264 --> 01:55:38,014
That is so mean. Come on.

1628
01:55:40,181 --> 01:55:41,098
She looks good. Doesn't she?

1629
01:56:05,764 --> 01:56:06,431
Ouch!

1630
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:09,848
Hey, Suz! Are you OK?

1631
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:13,681
Oh, my God! Is everything OK?

1632
01:56:13,973 --> 01:56:14,639
Suzie! Are you OK?

1633
01:56:14,681 --> 01:56:16,098
-Varun! What happened to you?
-Go away.

1634
01:56:16,764 --> 01:56:18,681
Suzie, are you alright?
-Yeah. I am fine, Varun. Thanks.

1635
01:56:21,306 --> 01:56:23,223
-Is it OK?
-Nothing will happen, Bhanu.

1636
01:56:23,264 --> 01:56:24,306
Everything will be alright.

1637
01:56:28,473 --> 01:56:30,639
Hey! What happened?

1638
01:56:31,098 --> 01:56:32,556
Why did you get Bhanu to that place? Why?

1639
01:56:32,889 --> 01:56:34,098
Kill her, both of you.

1640
01:56:34,264 --> 01:56:36,014
I would be in the prison
if something happened to her.

1641
01:56:36,056 --> 01:56:36,973
I'd behind the bars.

1642
01:56:37,264 --> 01:56:38,681
She wanted to have fun.
So, I brought her to the party.

1643
01:56:38,723 --> 01:56:41,348
Why should there be fun?
Who bought her this dress? Was it you?

1644
01:56:41,556 --> 01:56:43,681
She liked it when we went shopping.
So, I bought it.

1645
01:56:43,764 --> 01:56:45,889
Shut up, man! Are you even my friend?

1646
01:56:46,556 --> 01:56:48,556
Bringing her here will make me furious.
But, you did. Can't you understand?

1647
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:50,431
Varun! Scold me if you want.

1648
01:56:50,681 --> 01:56:52,723
You are angry with me.
What has he done?

1649
01:56:52,889 --> 01:56:54,764
-Why are you telling me?
-He is my friend.

1650
01:56:54,973 --> 01:56:57,556
-That is my wish. You just shut up.
-Why should I be calm?

1651
01:56:57,806 --> 01:56:59,056
You have a problem with me.

1652
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:01,556
I've been noticing from the day I came.
You don't want me to stay here.

1653
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:03,723
Yes. You are right.
I don't want you to come to America.

1654
01:57:03,973 --> 01:57:06,806
I don't want you to visit our house.
I don't like it at all that you came here.

1655
01:57:07,113 --> 01:57:08,389
I dropped Suzie after seeing you.

1656
01:57:08,848 --> 01:57:09,889
What did I do?

1657
01:57:10,098 --> 01:57:12,056
-You dropped her. Why are you scolding me?
-This is all because of you.

1658
01:57:12,848 --> 01:57:15,264
What's this dress?
Did you ever wear such a dress?

1659
01:57:15,348 --> 01:57:16,264
Do you know how you look in it?

1660
01:57:16,723 --> 01:57:18,932
I will wear it. I will wear it for sure
and whatever I want.

1661
01:57:19,612 --> 01:57:21,181
Don't look at me if you have any problem.

1662
01:57:22,681 --> 01:57:24,306
You never talk to me properly.

1663
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:25,764
You always ill-treat me.

1664
01:57:26,223 --> 01:57:28,806
You have to be straight forward.
You should be gutsy.

1665
01:57:29,181 --> 01:57:32,056
I am gutsy and I express my feelings.
That is my character.

1666
01:57:32,848 --> 01:57:34,223
I don't different kinds of emotions.

1667
01:57:34,264 --> 01:57:37,181
I've known a lot about your character
in the coach and in pictures.

1668
01:57:37,264 --> 01:57:38,473
-I've seen a lot.
-What?

1669
01:57:39,223 --> 01:57:41,473
Coach? You mean Sailu and I?

1670
01:57:41,984 --> 01:57:42,647
Damn!

1671
01:57:42,847 --> 01:57:45,681
Can you think like that just because
I am with a girl?

1672
01:57:45,764 --> 01:57:49,264
How can you get to conclusions?
You made me bad and rejected my love.

1673
01:57:49,348 --> 01:57:50,181
Just like that.

1674
01:57:50,764 --> 01:57:52,723
-Do you want to talk with Sailu?
-I don't care.

1675
01:57:53,181 --> 01:57:54,264
You definitely care.

1676
01:57:54,723 --> 01:57:57,056
That is why you came.
You came even though I denied.

1677
01:57:59,598 --> 01:58:02,098
I came to see my sister.
I'm not here for you.

1678
01:58:02,723 --> 01:58:05,056
Then, why did you wear this dress?
Whom did you wear it for? Why?

1679
01:58:05,306 --> 01:58:07,848
Why did you come to me wearing it?
It is not for you.

1680
01:58:08,848 --> 01:58:10,723
I will leave right now
if you talk like that.

1681
01:58:11,181 --> 01:58:13,889
Go, please. I please you to leave.
I plead you. Go.

1682
01:58:16,264 --> 01:58:17,639
Go. Go back to your village.

1683
01:58:25,306 --> 01:58:26,681
Hey, you! Are you alright?

1684
01:58:39,848 --> 01:58:42,098
Sister! I will leave.

1685
01:58:43,223 --> 01:58:43,931
Where?

1686
01:58:44,848 --> 01:58:45,723
I will go back to dad.

1687
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:48,598
I am missing him.

1688
01:58:49,473 --> 01:58:52,139
You are feeling better, right?
Where will you go?

1689
01:58:52,348 --> 01:58:54,431
Are you crazy?
Will you not stay until I conceive?

1690
01:58:54,598 --> 01:58:55,806
Won't you see the baby?

1691
01:58:56,973 --> 01:58:57,931
I will leave.

1692
01:59:00,014 --> 01:59:01,973
-I will leave.
-What happened to you? Why are you crying?

1693
01:59:04,431 --> 01:59:05,681
Please book my ticket.

1694
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:08,098
I am not feeling good here.

1695
01:59:08,931 --> 01:59:10,014
Bhanu, stop crying.

1696
01:59:11,598 --> 01:59:12,306
Bhanu!

1697
01:59:12,889 --> 01:59:14,056
Wait! You sit down.

1698
01:59:15,889 --> 01:59:17,973
Let's book her ticket.
She might be missing her dad.

1699
01:59:19,431 --> 01:59:21,931
What happened, dear?
Nothing. I just can't be here.

1700
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:23,181
How is your sister doing?

1701
01:59:23,389 --> 01:59:24,556
She is doing great.

1702
01:59:24,889 --> 01:59:26,931
The doctor said that there's no problem.

1703
01:59:27,348 --> 01:59:30,806
I will come back, dad.
I will talk to your sister. Don't worry.

1704
01:59:31,598 --> 01:59:32,139
OK, dear?

1705
01:59:34,139 --> 01:59:35,056
How can you leave?

1706
01:59:35,681 --> 01:59:37,639
Will you leave
without visiting me in America?

1707
01:59:37,973 --> 01:59:39,181
It won't be good on your part.

1708
01:59:39,556 --> 01:59:42,348
Listen! I will stop talking to you
if you don't come.

1709
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:43,889
Give to your brother-in-law.
I will talk to him.

1710
01:59:44,514 --> 01:59:46,764
Brother-in-law!
Sumathi wants me to visit her.

1711
01:59:47,098 --> 01:59:48,181
Shall I go for a week?

1712
01:59:49,264 --> 01:59:50,889
-I've to meet her before I go back.
-You carry on.

1713
01:59:50,931 --> 01:59:51,973
Otherwise, she will kill me.

1714
01:59:52,764 --> 01:59:53,389
She's on call.

1715
01:59:53,931 --> 01:59:54,764
OK. Sure.

1716
01:59:56,264 --> 01:59:56,973
Hey, he said OK.

1717
01:59:57,473 --> 02:00:00,931
I will come.
-Hey, Varun! Drop her at Sumathi's house.

1718
02:00:04,514 --> 02:00:06,014
I am on duty,

1719
02:00:06,806 --> 02:00:08,223
But, I am going out of town.

1720
02:00:08,473 --> 02:00:10,014
Will you go tomorrow?
-Yeah. OK.

1721
02:00:10,056 --> 02:00:12,139
Just drop her.
-OK.

1722
02:00:39,764 --> 02:00:40,139
Get down.

1723
02:00:50,681 --> 02:00:53,306
Take this ticket and get on the bus.
You can go to Sumathi's house.

1724
02:01:34,889 --> 02:01:35,431
Didn't you go?

1725
02:01:37,306 --> 02:01:38,306
The bus left. Come.

1726
02:01:39,306 --> 02:01:40,889
No need. I will go by bus.

1727
02:01:42,556 --> 02:01:44,348
I said that the bus left.
That's the last bus.

1728
02:01:44,889 --> 02:01:46,889
Bhanu, stop messing it up.
Shut up and sit in the car.

1729
02:01:48,014 --> 02:01:49,973
I won't come. I will not come with you.
-Bhanu, come.

1730
02:01:50,473 --> 02:01:51,681
Varun! Leave me.

1731
02:01:51,889 --> 02:01:53,639
Pat! There seems to be a problem. Over.

1732
02:01:57,139 --> 02:01:59,848
Bhanu! They'll put me behind the bars
for harassment if we stay here any longer.

1733
02:02:00,098 --> 02:02:01,389
Please don't make a big scene.

1734
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:17,056
Bhanu.

1735
02:02:17,973 --> 02:02:19,223
Bhanu, what happened?

1736
02:02:19,764 --> 02:02:20,889
Bhanu, why are you crying?

1737
02:02:20,973 --> 02:02:22,764
You should be put behind the bars.

1738
02:02:23,098 --> 02:02:24,764
Yes. You are harassing me.

1739
02:02:27,139 --> 02:02:30,348
I came to a different country.
You don't at least care about me.

1740
02:02:30,389 --> 02:02:32,764
What have I done, Varun?
Why are you angry with me?

1741
02:02:33,473 --> 02:02:34,848
Are you taking revenge on me
for rejecting your proposal?

1742
02:02:34,973 --> 02:02:37,098
No! I am not taking any revenge.

1743
02:02:37,306 --> 02:02:38,556
You have that right to express.

1744
02:02:39,764 --> 02:02:44,098
I have a problem. That is why
I am trying to stay away from you.

1745
02:02:44,681 --> 02:02:48,973
I am trying to be busy or
fall in love with someone.

1746
02:02:50,389 --> 02:02:54,056
But, nothing seems to work out.
Neither mentally nor physically!

1747
02:02:55,848 --> 02:03:00,598
I was in my trials and you came.
How can I handle myself?

1748
02:03:02,248 --> 02:03:03,056
It's horrible.

1749
02:03:05,223 --> 02:03:07,181
Bhanu!
Do you know why I don't look at you?

1750
02:03:09,973 --> 02:03:11,598
I might like you even more if I do that.

1751
02:03:14,931 --> 02:03:20,223
I miss those crops at
Banswada and that tractor. Especially you!

1752
02:03:21,348 --> 02:03:23,181
They're still in my thoughts, Bhanu.

1753
02:03:24,764 --> 02:03:26,139
I like you a lot, Bhanu.

1754
02:03:26,389 --> 02:03:27,723
I like you very much.

1755
02:03:38,181 --> 02:03:40,848
Bhanu! Why don't we just be friends?

1756
02:03:41,514 --> 02:03:42,306
Isn't that possible?

1757
02:03:43,514 --> 02:03:45,639
You moved on and you're happy.

1758
02:03:46,764 --> 02:03:49,473
I will take care of myself, Bhanu.
I'll be fine. I will get over it.

1759
02:03:49,764 --> 02:03:50,639
Let's be friends.

1760
02:03:53,214 --> 02:03:53,806
Bhanu?

1761
02:03:55,389 --> 02:03:55,889
-OK.
-OK?

1762
02:03:56,556 --> 02:03:58,681
Bhanu! Do you want to see my world?

1763
02:03:59,764 --> 02:04:02,139
I mean just like how you showed me
your place Banswada.

1764
02:04:02,306 --> 02:04:02,639
OK.

1765
02:04:31,889 --> 02:04:37,764
"Her feelings within are manifested"

1766
02:04:39,014 --> 02:04:44,806
"But, my heart seems to be ignorant"

1767
02:04:46,139 --> 02:04:52,106
"She must've found what
she was in quest of"

1768
02:04:53,223 --> 02:04:59,098
"But, she is helpless in claiming it"

1769
02:04:59,139 --> 02:05:05,139
"Though you call out to me
and ask me to leave"

1770
02:05:06,223 --> 02:05:11,889
"I am coming and I'll be by your side"

1771
02:05:14,014 --> 02:05:20,006
"I feel tremors in my heart"

1772
02:05:21,264 --> 02:05:27,264
"I feel questioned in your presence"

1773
02:05:28,348 --> 02:05:33,791
"I feel tremors in my heart"

1774
02:05:35,708 --> 02:05:41,649
"I feel questioned in your presence"

1775
02:05:43,681 --> 02:05:45,598
It has been many days.
-How can I leave just like that?

1776
02:05:45,639 --> 02:05:47,014
Thanks for coming.
-Nice meeting you.

1777
02:05:47,056 --> 02:05:48,889
He's my brother-in-law's brother Varun.

1778
02:05:49,723 --> 02:05:51,556
Hi. How was your trip?
-Hello. I am Varun.

1779
02:05:51,598 --> 02:05:52,931
Do you have the picture of your fiancé?

1780
02:05:56,889 --> 02:06:02,639
"The agonizing pain in my heart"

1781
02:06:03,973 --> 02:06:09,681
"It makes me feel so out of place"

1782
02:06:10,139 --> 02:06:16,081
"Are you paying heed to my silence"

1783
02:06:17,306 --> 02:06:23,223
"It speaks its heart out to you

1784
02:06:26,264 --> 02:06:28,723
Hey! I'll take you to some place.
Is that OK?

1785
02:06:30,264 --> 02:06:33,889
Why are you specially asking me?
-That's something. Are you OK with it?

1786
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:41,552
-Hey!
-Brother-in-law! Hi.

1787
02:06:41,682 --> 02:06:42,278
Shailu.

1788
02:06:42,399 --> 02:06:44,264
-What is this sudden surprise?
-I wanted to see you.

1789
02:06:44,306 --> 02:06:45,473
-You didn't even call me.
-I am just kidding.

1790
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:47,658
-Where is Vamsi?
-Vamsi. Come.

1791
02:06:48,098 --> 02:06:50,026
Hey, Vamsi! How are you?
-Hey, Varun! How are you, man?

1792
02:06:50,264 --> 02:06:53,148
Long time, man!
Vamsi, she's Bhanu. Bhanu, he's Vamsi.

1793
02:06:53,348 --> 02:06:56,428
Hey, Bhanu! We got married because
of your sister's wedding.

1794
02:06:56,681 --> 02:06:58,223
We are very thankful to you.

1795
02:06:58,889 --> 02:07:01,014
It's not because of her sister's wedding.
It is because of that coach, right?

1796
02:07:02,389 --> 02:07:05,473
-That's on the train.
-We had discussed in the train that day.

1797
02:07:05,514 --> 02:07:08,551
You'd not be married if we did not plan to
arrange visa documents. -Oh, yeah.

1798
02:07:08,823 --> 02:07:09,270
True.

1799
02:07:10,139 --> 02:07:11,264
Isn't that right, Vamsi?

1800
02:07:40,723 --> 02:07:43,223
Hey, Bhanu! Why did wear a saree?
We are not going out, right?

1801
02:07:43,473 --> 02:07:45,848
I don't have anything other than this.
I have to wash my clothes.

1802
02:07:58,223 --> 02:07:58,848
Bhanu!

1803
02:08:00,389 --> 02:08:02,306
You can sleep in the room upstairs.

1804
02:08:03,181 --> 02:08:04,056
I am not sleepy.

1805
02:08:09,931 --> 02:08:10,806
Say something.

1806
02:08:13,723 --> 02:08:15,514
Bhanu! Don't mind me asking you something.

1807
02:08:17,098 --> 02:08:20,723
You never say sorry,
thank you or love you.

1808
02:08:22,014 --> 02:08:23,723
I can. But,
it depends on the other person.

1809
02:08:27,223 --> 02:08:28,389
You are a famous doctor, right?

1810
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:31,306
There is nothing about being famous.
I am just a doctor.

1811
02:08:32,264 --> 02:08:33,014
That is my mom's wish.

1812
02:08:34,098 --> 02:08:35,764
That is why I study medicine and
I am serious about it.

1813
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:37,889
Will you start up a hospital in India?

1814
02:08:38,723 --> 02:08:42,848
No.
I applied for America's top university.

1815
02:08:43,473 --> 02:08:44,473
I am waiting for my admission.

1816
02:08:45,181 --> 02:08:46,764
It is my dream to become a neurosurgeon.

1817
02:08:47,431 --> 02:08:48,181
Brain doctor?

1818
02:09:11,181 --> 02:09:12,598
Varun! Get up.
Varun.

1819
02:09:14,556 --> 02:09:15,723
Bhanu, where are you going?

1820
02:09:34,431 --> 02:09:40,348
"Distance between us begins to melt away"

1821
02:09:41,407 --> 02:09:47,088
"Dream like reality promises to persist"

1822
02:09:47,783 --> 02:09:53,730
"Though there is everything in my world"

1823
02:09:54,848 --> 02:10:00,514
"You must be the missing
piece of the puzzle"

1824
02:10:01,931 --> 02:10:07,881
"Though there is no distance parting us"

1825
02:10:09,011 --> 02:10:14,925
"I might still be in hesitation"

1826
02:10:27,181 --> 02:10:30,639
Hey, Bhanu! Your wishes might
come true if you pray here.

1827
02:10:31,306 --> 02:10:34,306
It is meant for lovers.
But, you can still try.

1828
02:10:37,223 --> 02:10:42,681
All I wish for is that
Bhanu stays with me in my world forever.

1829
02:10:43,348 --> 02:10:45,431
He should come into my world.

1830
02:10:48,139 --> 02:10:51,348
I might stay here forever if
I stay here any longer.

1831
02:10:51,556 --> 02:10:54,681
God! Please send me away to my place.

1832
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:57,931
What did you wish for?
-What about you?

1833
02:11:11,889 --> 02:11:12,306
Come in.

1834
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:13,098
Thanks.

1835
02:11:28,931 --> 02:11:32,139
-Congratulations!
-Thanks, buddy.

1836
02:11:32,264 --> 02:11:33,139
Congrats, bro.

1837
02:11:33,556 --> 02:11:35,348
Bujji.
-I am really proud of you.

1838
02:11:35,598 --> 02:11:36,306
Thanks, guys.

1839
02:11:37,181 --> 02:11:40,473
Emory! Emory!

1840
02:11:44,889 --> 02:11:45,848
Are you leaving, then?

1841
02:11:48,806 --> 02:11:51,764
It is just 3 more months. Stay back.

1842
02:11:52,931 --> 02:11:54,431
I cannot go if I do not leave now.

1843
02:11:59,764 --> 02:12:02,889
You like Varun, right?
Why don't you stay back?

1844
02:12:05,473 --> 02:12:07,098
I like him. That is why
I am saying this.

1845
02:12:07,556 --> 02:12:09,098
I can't stay here by his side
with all my heart.

1846
02:12:13,014 --> 02:12:14,181
Ask Varun if he will come.

1847
02:12:14,806 --> 02:12:16,514
You told me to ask Raju.

1848
02:12:21,139 --> 02:12:22,098
Shall I ask him?

1849
02:12:23,431 --> 02:12:25,556
Varun won't be happy if he comes there.

1850
02:12:25,889 --> 02:12:26,723
He cannot be complete.

1851
02:12:27,764 --> 02:12:29,306
He should become a famous doctor here.

1852
02:12:29,639 --> 02:12:30,181
Look at him.

1853
02:12:38,806 --> 02:12:40,348
How can there be conditions in love?

1854
02:12:51,223 --> 02:12:53,181
Bujji! what happened?
-I'm sad.

1855
02:12:53,223 --> 02:12:54,764
Why, dear? What happened?

1856
02:12:55,639 --> 02:12:57,556
I don't want Bhanu sis to leave.

1857
02:13:00,598 --> 02:13:01,806
You can make her stay.

1858
02:13:03,223 --> 02:13:03,514
No.

1859
02:13:04,014 --> 02:13:05,931
You could.
-I can't.

1860
02:13:07,098 --> 02:13:08,098
Yes. You could.

1861
02:13:10,098 --> 02:13:11,139
I could maybe if I leave.

1862
02:13:13,639 --> 02:13:16,181
She might stay if I leave. Is that OK?

1863
02:13:16,931 --> 02:13:19,723
No! I don't want you to leave.

1864
02:13:27,473 --> 02:13:28,431
Take care, Bhanu.

1865
02:13:29,639 --> 02:13:31,723
See you, brother-in-law.
-Take care...

1866
02:13:35,348 --> 02:13:36,764
You're very special, Bhanu.

1867
02:13:57,223 --> 02:13:57,806
Varun.

1868
02:14:00,473 --> 02:14:01,181
Thank you, Bhanu.

1869
02:14:06,931 --> 02:14:08,181
It is so disturbing, Bhanu.

1870
02:14:09,181 --> 02:14:10,389
I feel like losing my life.

1871
02:14:11,764 --> 02:14:14,098
You are a good person, Varun.
You're special.

1872
02:14:14,931 --> 02:14:15,806
Impressed!

1873
02:14:25,514 --> 02:14:27,806
I saw it. You can see.

1874
02:14:29,806 --> 02:14:30,431
I'll stop it.

1875
02:14:39,681 --> 02:14:40,264
Hey, Bhanu!

1876
02:14:40,889 --> 02:14:43,931
You said that our wishes come true
if we pray. Shall I pray for it?

1877
02:14:44,098 --> 02:14:44,389
Hmm.

1878
02:14:44,931 --> 02:14:47,931
Stay back, Bhanu.
That's what I wished for.

1879
02:14:58,264 --> 02:15:00,014
Let's go, Bhanu. We are getting late.

1880
02:15:03,264 --> 02:15:06,306
Bhanu! Keep your passport
and boarding pass ready.

1881
02:15:06,431 --> 02:15:08,306
[flight announcements]

1882
02:15:10,056 --> 02:15:10,973
Announcement!

1883
02:15:18,473 --> 02:15:19,014
Bye.

1884
02:15:24,598 --> 02:15:26,556
Thanks for everything, Bhanu.

1885
02:15:54,264 --> 02:15:54,931
Varun!

1886
02:17:12,473 --> 02:17:14,306
What is it, dear?
Why did you come suddenly?

1887
02:17:14,473 --> 02:17:15,139
Nothing, uncle.

1888
02:17:15,514 --> 02:17:17,348
Is everything alright?
-Yeah. Everything is fine.

1889
02:17:17,389 --> 02:17:18,389
Give me your bag.

1890
02:17:18,764 --> 02:17:19,764
That's OK, uncle.

1891
02:17:26,598 --> 02:17:28,889
Uncle! I should talk with Bhanu.

1892
02:17:36,389 --> 02:17:37,389
Do you want to talk with Bhanu?

1893
02:17:39,056 --> 02:17:39,889
OK, dear.

1894
02:17:53,806 --> 02:17:54,723
Why did you come?

1895
02:17:57,223 --> 02:17:58,681
Why did you hug me at the airport?

1896
02:18:01,723 --> 02:18:03,681
You left. But, you came back to hug me.

1897
02:18:10,431 --> 02:18:11,473
What's this?

1898
02:18:16,181 --> 02:18:18,514
You don't like him. You like me.

1899
02:18:19,473 --> 02:18:20,806
But, you got ready to marry him.

1900
02:18:21,264 --> 02:18:22,139
Why? But, why?

1901
02:18:22,389 --> 02:18:25,598
Oh! Right. You're Bhanumati! One piece!

1902
02:18:28,056 --> 02:18:31,181
I told you many times that I like you and
I love you.

1903
02:18:31,973 --> 02:18:33,639
I told you that
I will wait for you any longer.

1904
02:18:35,098 --> 02:18:37,264
But, that groom doesn't wait.
Remember that.

1905
02:18:39,139 --> 02:18:39,889
You'll get married.

1906
02:18:41,598 --> 02:18:45,181
Both of us can't do anything after that.

1907
02:18:47,973 --> 02:18:48,806
Think about it and let me know.

1908
02:18:54,764 --> 02:18:55,223
Bhanu!

1909
02:18:57,098 --> 02:19:00,556
It's OK if you do not like me
and marry someone else.

1910
02:19:00,848 --> 02:19:03,264
That's because it is your choice and
I hope that you will be happy.

1911
02:19:03,514 --> 02:19:05,014
I can't take it if you do not be happy.

1912
02:19:05,806 --> 02:19:10,514
I won't accept and live with that lie.

1913
02:19:11,556 --> 02:19:14,723
You can lie to me but
don't cheat yourself.

1914
02:19:20,014 --> 02:19:21,764
Darling! Haven't you slept yet?
-Dad.

1915
02:19:26,139 --> 02:19:26,556
My dear!

1916
02:19:28,264 --> 02:19:30,181
Shall I ask you something?
-What happened, Dad?

1917
02:19:31,223 --> 02:19:32,306
Dad likes him.

1918
02:19:32,931 --> 02:19:37,598
The wedding should be done anyway
and it is getting late. He's our neighbor.

1919
02:19:38,431 --> 02:19:42,139
Did you agree to the wedding
because if those reasons?

1920
02:19:47,723 --> 02:19:52,098
I can't bear it if you love someone
and marry someone else for my sake.

1921
02:19:53,056 --> 02:19:57,848
Not just me. Dads can't bear it.

1922
02:19:58,723 --> 02:20:01,889
I can't be happy even if you stay here.

1923
02:20:02,181 --> 02:20:02,598
Dad!

1924
02:20:04,764 --> 02:20:05,848
I know it all.

1925
02:20:07,306 --> 02:20:10,514
How can I be happy if
you don't marry Varun?

1926
02:20:11,764 --> 02:20:16,098
My darling! Listen to me and marry Varun.

1927
02:20:17,098 --> 02:20:18,389
I will take care of the rest.

1928
02:20:20,098 --> 02:20:21,098
Will you marry him?

1929
02:20:21,764 --> 02:20:24,139
My darling will listen to her dad.

1930
02:21:13,473 --> 02:21:14,931
What happened? Why are you sad?

1931
02:21:16,223 --> 02:21:18,389
I have different ideas
but something else happened.

1932
02:21:20,056 --> 02:21:20,681
That's life.

1933
02:21:23,681 --> 02:21:25,889
Wonders don't happen in this world.

1934
02:21:26,514 --> 02:21:27,306
You are right.

1935
02:21:28,723 --> 02:21:30,681
We take birth and grow up in one place.

1936
02:21:30,973 --> 02:21:33,181
We marry someone and
go to some other place.

1937
02:21:34,889 --> 02:21:36,764
That's how it is. It is the same for all.

1938
02:21:39,473 --> 02:21:41,514
Hey...what's this?

1939
02:21:41,806 --> 02:21:44,389
That's not needed.
It is not needed at all.

1940
02:21:44,806 --> 02:21:49,431
Your prince came for you
but he's taking you away.

1941
02:21:49,973 --> 02:21:55,473
He came into your world for you
to stay with you by your side.

1942
02:21:57,973 --> 02:21:59,473
-Really?
-Yeah.

1943
02:21:59,514 --> 02:22:00,389
Really?

1944
02:22:01,431 --> 02:22:03,931
You prayed for it and that happened.

1945
02:22:06,181 --> 02:22:10,764
"He is special and it's
not easy to get him"

1946
02:22:11,181 --> 02:22:14,473
"He's is a good person"

1947
02:22:25,806 --> 02:22:28,723
Sister! I'm not going to America.
I will stay here.

1948
02:22:31,014 --> 02:22:31,848
Oh! Is it?

1949
02:22:34,264 --> 02:22:35,139
Varun!

1950
02:22:41,889 --> 02:22:42,431
Bhanu.

1951
02:22:48,056 --> 02:22:49,473
Bhanu...what happened?

1952
02:22:50,098 --> 02:22:51,431
Why are you crying, Bhanu?

1953
02:22:53,139 --> 02:22:53,806
Pick me up.

1954
02:22:55,806 --> 02:22:56,723
Hey...

1955
02:22:57,681 --> 02:22:58,556
Bhanu.

1956
02:22:59,014 --> 02:23:01,014
Oh, my! What is this?
Did you come here for me?

1957
02:23:01,306 --> 02:23:04,681
Will you stay here? My darling!

1958
02:23:06,931 --> 02:23:07,764
I didn't understand you.

1959
02:23:08,348 --> 02:23:10,556
I troubled you and
I'm sorry about that.

1960
02:23:10,889 --> 02:23:12,473
Why did you think a lot about this?

1961
02:23:12,973 --> 02:23:14,723
You should've told me that.

1962
02:23:15,306 --> 02:23:17,014
You talked about your world.

1963
02:23:17,639 --> 02:23:19,139
But, you are my world.

1964
02:23:19,973 --> 02:23:21,139
You're my one piece.

1965
02:23:21,473 --> 02:23:23,431
I'm not the one. You are my one piece.

1966
02:23:23,681 --> 02:23:25,806
You are my one piece. My husband!

1967
02:23:28,014 --> 02:23:28,764
It's raining.

1968
02:23:30,181 --> 02:23:30,973
Shall we go?

1969
02:23:39,681 --> 02:23:41,306
Hey, Bhanu! Did you see that?

1970
02:23:41,639 --> 02:23:42,889
Our hospital is behind that.

1971
02:23:51,098 --> 02:23:53,181
Anything is fine. But, no kisses!

1972
02:23:53,389 --> 02:23:54,598
-Why?
-See this.

1973
02:23:56,681 --> 02:23:59,223
Oh! This one is morphed by my friend Ali.

1974
02:23:59,306 --> 02:24:01,056
I won't believe it. He should say that.

1975
02:24:01,431 --> 02:24:03,848
Hey, crazy! Bloody!
Are you out of your mind?

1976
02:24:03,889 --> 02:24:05,348
Hey! This is Bhanumati.

1977
02:24:05,598 --> 02:24:06,848
Is it? Let me show you.

1978
02:24:07,804 --> 02:24:08,523
Hey.
