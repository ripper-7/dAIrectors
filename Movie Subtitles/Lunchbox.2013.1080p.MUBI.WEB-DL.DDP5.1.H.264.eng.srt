1
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,085
It's raining today.

2
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:28,126
Don't play in the playground.

3
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:30,751
It will be very muddy.

4
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:33,335
If you slip, you'll break your head.

5
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,376
- Play inside.
- Okay.

6
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:40,251
And don't walk under trees.

7
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:43,293
One fell nearby yesterday.

8
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:46,668
And an overpass collapsed,
we saw it on the news.

9
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:48,793
But it has stopped raining.

10
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,960
It can always start again.

11
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,210
Here he is.

12
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:56,460
Hey!

13
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:59,876
Wait a minute!

14
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,001
Did you remember all the spices?

15
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,626
No, Auntie, I think I forgot something.

16
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,960
I knew it! I could smell it up here!

17
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,876
Here.

18
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:45,585
Thank you, Auntie.

19
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,460
Just a little bit does it.

20
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:50,793
Okay.

21
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:55,876
This new recipe
will do the trick for you.

22
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,251
Auntie.

23
00:02:57,335 --> 00:03:00,043
I know you're laughing.

24
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:03,126
Don't believe me now.
But one day you'll see.

25
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:06,835
Smells perfect!

26
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:12,210
One bite of that
and he'll build you a Taj Mahal.

27
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,376
The Taj Mahal is a tomb, Auntie.

28
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,085
I know that!

29
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,168
Take it back.

30
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,460
Fernandes.

31
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:57,626
Fernandes, this is Shaikh.
Shaikh, Mr Fernandes.

32
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,918
Shaikh used to work in Saudi Arabia
as a chief accountant.

33
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:04,043
He will take over your responsibilities
when you leave us next month.

34
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:07,418
- Shaikh comes with very good references.
- Very pleased to meet you, sir.

35
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:10,262
Mr Shroff speaks very highly of you.

36
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,918
I had him join us early so that you can
train him in all that you do in Claims.

37
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:17,293
Good luck.

38
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:26,751
Mr Shroff said
you've been here for 35 years.

39
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,001
Your colleagues will miss you a lot.

40
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:35,668
How does it feel, sir?

41
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:40,876
I mean, your golden years
are about to start. How does it feel?

42
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:44,751
- Oh, fantastic.
- Fantastic.

43
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,418
Can we start the training?

44
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,085
Sure.

45
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,626
But it's lunchtime right now.

46
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:11,960
You come at 4:45.

47
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,460
Four forty-five, 4:45.

48
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:17,585
Okay, sir, no problem.
I'll come later then.

49
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:20,001
Thank you very much, sir.
Nice to meet you.

50
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,168
<i>In today's class the recipe is</i>

51
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:42,418
<i>the all-time favorite Paneer Do Pyaza.</i>

52
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,918
Auntie.

53
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,085
Auntie.

54
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,960
- Are you asleep?
- What happened?

55
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,293
Auntie, the lunchbox is back.

56
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:21,960
So? Go on.

57
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,210
It's completely empty.

58
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:25,710
Completely?

59
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,418
Yes!

60
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,126
It's like he's licked it clean!

61
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,751
What did I tell you?

62
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:36,293
This is just the beginning.

63
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:48,543
Auntie, turn the tape off.
Rajeev is back.

64
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,126
Okay.

65
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,751
Good, you came back early.

66
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:13,543
How was lunch today?

67
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:14,751
It was good.

68
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,460
Just good?

69
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:25,793
Good, as usual.

70
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:30,210
You sent the lunchbox back empty

71
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,960
so I thought...

72
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,626
Your cauliflower was really good.

73
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,751
It was very good.

74
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:50,960
Hello.

75
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:53,960
Just reached home.

76
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:57,793
I was waiting for your update.

77
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,293
Okay.

78
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:04,668
Was it so boring?

79
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,251
What can you do?

80
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,793
Auntie?

81
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,210
Auntie.

82
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:36,168
What happened now, sir?

83
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:39,001
I'm retiring next month.

84
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,543
I'll be canceling the lunchbox service.

85
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:44,460
Okay, sir. I'll make a note of it.

86
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,960
I'll settle up at the end of the month.

87
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,710
Okay, sir. No problem.

88
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:51,335
Fine.

89
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,001
And...

90
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,293
Who made the lunch today?

91
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:59,376
We did, sir. Why?

92
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,835
The food was good!

93
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:05,376
- What?
- It was good, very good.

94
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,793
Maintain the same standard. Okay?

95
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,876
What's with him today?

96
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,751
The cauliflower did it for us!

97
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,668
Let's make it again tomorrow.

98
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,293
Here, serve this.

99
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:27,793
Hey, hey.

100
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:35,289
What is this?

101
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:42,210
Mr Fernandes, our ball went inside
your balcony.

102
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,751
Please, can we have it?

103
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:45,335
Please, sir?

104
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:53,793
- Do I look like your servant?
- No.

105
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:56,876
Please. We'll not play here.
We'll play on another side.

106
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,960
If you play in front of this door again,
I'll chase you down in the street.

107
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:07,126
- Please. Please.
- Sir, we'll play on the other side.

108
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,876
Mr Fernandes, please. Sorry.

109
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:42,335
Ila!

110
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:43,793
Oh, Ila.

111
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:47,126
Ila.

112
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,668
Yes, Auntie, I'm here.

113
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,835
- Did you call out to me earlier?
- Yes.

114
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,168
I was changing Uncle's diaper.

115
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,043
What did Rajeev say?

116
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:00,043
Nothing.

117
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:01,168
What?

118
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Auntie, the lunchbox
went to someone else.

119
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,126
I don't think Rajeev got it.

120
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,835
It went to someone else
who liked it and finished it.

121
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:16,793
But the delivery men
never make a mistake.

122
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:23,460
What is it?

123
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,501
Good morning, sir. How are you?

124
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:39,960
Good morning.

125
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:44,126
Sir, I came by yesterday.
You were not to be seen.

126
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,001
I was right here. You were late.

127
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,585
I was here at 4:45.

128
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:49,460
I was here. You were late.

129
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:51,543
No problem, sir.

130
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,126
Are these Claims files, sir?

131
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,418
This is the Claims Department.

132
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,918
When do we start the training, sir?

133
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,293
Let's do it.

134
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,418
Definitely, sir?

135
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:16,043
Let's do it after lunch.

136
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:19,668
- I'll come back then.
- Yes, come back.

137
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,626
- Are you sure, sir?
- Yes.

138
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,418
You'll definitely be here?

139
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:27,126
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

140
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:02,210
<i>Thank you for sending back
an empty lunchbox.</i>

141
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:05,626
<i>I had made that food for my husband.</i>

142
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:10,751
<i>And when it came back empty,
I thought he would say something to me.</i>

143
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,835
<i>For a few hours, I thought the way to
the heart is really through the stomach.</i>

144
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,460
<i>In return for those hours...</i>

145
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,001
<i>I am sending you Paneer.</i>

146
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:21,001
<i>My husband's favorite.</i>

147
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,626
<i>Ila.</i>

148
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:30,043
Auntie, this letter business is strange.

149
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:32,585
Ila, you owe a thank you.

150
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,210
What happens if this goes to Rajeev?

151
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:37,918
So good.

152
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:41,501
Rajeev ate someone else's food yesterday
and didn't notice.

153
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:43,460
Let him notice today.

154
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,668
Should I write something else?

155
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,751
No. Keep it short!

156
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:17,335
Auntie!

157
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,376
Auntie.

158
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,710
Are you asleep?

159
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:21,876
What happened?

160
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,085
Auntie.

161
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,710
The lunchbox has come back.

162
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:28,001
It's empty again, but with a reply.

163
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:30,001
- A reply?
- Yes.

164
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,626
What does it say?

165
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,043
And it's not in Rajeev's handwriting.

166
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:35,543
Read it!

167
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:40,085
"Dear, Ila,
the food was very salty today."

168
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,460
What else does it say?

169
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:44,043
"Dear, Ila,
the food was very salty today."

170
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:46,876
What?
No "Thank you," no "Hello"?

171
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,460
"Dear Ila,
the food was very salty today."

172
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:50,876
Who does he think he is?

173
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,001
He empties the lunchbox
and then complains!

174
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:55,543
Wait a minute.

175
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,210
Here, use this.

176
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,585
No, I don't like all this.

177
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:07,835
I'll tell the delivery man
the box is going to the wrong address.

178
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:10,043
He should've thanked you!

179
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:13,043
No, I really don't like this.

180
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:15,210
Why? It's not like you know him.

181
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:31,626
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?

182
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,473
Good.

183
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:42,085
I couldn't find you at your desk,
so I came here.

184
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:48,335
You were reading in the canteen,
so I didn't want to disturb.

185
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:56,126
Your lunchbox has an amazing aroma.

186
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,626
I could taste the food
without eating it!

187
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:10,085
Your wife, sir...

188
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,126
She has magic in her hands.

189
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:16,626
My wife is dead.

190
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,293
<i>Dear Ila, the salt was fine today.</i>

191
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,168
<i>The chili was a bit on the higher side.</i>

192
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:26,335
<i>But I had two bananas after lunch.</i>

193
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,918
<i>They helped to extinguish the fire
in my mouth.</i>

194
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,835
<i>And I think it'll also be good
for the motions.</i>

195
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:42,460
<i>There are so many people in this city
who eat only a banana or two for lunch.</i>

196
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:46,418
<i>It's cheap and it fills you up.</i>

197
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,376
<i>Hello.</i>

198
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:11,751
<i>My husband came home late last night.</i>

199
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,960
<i>He didn't say a word.</i>

200
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,210
<i>This morning he went to work.
My daughter went to school.</i>

201
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:26,085
<i>And I started cooking
with Deshpande Auntie.</i>

202
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:30,043
<i>She lives in the flat above us.</i>

203
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,876
<i>Her husband has been in a coma
for the last 15 years.</i>

204
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,418
<i>One day he woke up
and started staring at the ceiling fan.</i>

205
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:41,210
<i>Since then he does just that.</i>

206
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,835
<i>He stares at the fan all day...</i>

207
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:46,126
<i>and falls asleep at night.</i>

208
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,626
<i>In the morning he wakes up
and stares at the fan again.</i>

209
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,460
<i>He doesn't say anything.</i>

210
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:53,876
<i>This has been going on for 15 years.</i>

211
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,835
<i>Even the doctors have lost hope now.</i>

212
00:29:57,751 --> 00:30:00,460
<i>It's an old "Orient" model fan.</i>

213
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:03,001
<i>It is never switched off.</i>

214
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:08,085
<i>Auntie thinks
that the fan keeps him alive.</i>

215
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,918
<i>One day the power went off.</i>

216
00:30:12,418 --> 00:30:15,126
<i>And so did the fan.
Uncle's heartbeat slowed.</i>

217
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,585
<i>Luckily the power came back on.</i>

218
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,501
<i>After that, Deshpande Auntie
had a generator installed.</i>

219
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:30,418
<i>Deshpande Uncle stares at the fan.</i>

220
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,710
<i>My husband stares at his phone.</i>

221
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:34,376
<i>As if nothing else exists.</i>

222
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,210
<i>Maybe nothing else does...</i>

223
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,210
What do we live for?

224
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:53,543
Madam.

225
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,876
<i>Dear Ila, your husband sounds like
a busy man.</i>

226
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,293
<i>Life is very busy these days.</i>

227
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:06,668
<i>There are too many people,
and everyone wants what the other has.</i>

228
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:12,168
<i>Years ago, you could find a place to sit
in the train every now and then</i>

229
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,376
<i>but these days, it's difficult.</i>

230
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,668
<i>If Mr Deshpande wakes up now</i>

231
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:21,168
<i>he will see the difference and probably
go back to his Orient ceiling fan.</i>

232
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:26,460
<i>When my wife died,
she got a horizontal burial plot.</i>

233
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:30,043
<i>I tried to buy a burial plot for myself
the other day</i>

234
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:33,418
<i>and what they offered me
was a vertical one.</i>

235
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:36,543
<i>I've spent my whole life
standing in trains and buses,</i>

236
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:39,251
<i>now I'll have to stand
even when I'm dead.</i>

237
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:44,418
<i>Why don't you have another child?</i>

238
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:49,210
<i>Sometimes having a child
can help a marriage.</i>

239
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:11,626
Rajeev?

240
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,126
How is this?

241
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,543
It's nice.

242
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:20,001
You forgot.

243
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:25,210
The last time I wore this
was for our honeymoon.

244
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:30,710
I thought I'd try it today
and see if it needed altering.

245
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:34,126
But look. It fits perfectly.

246
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,543
- Doesn't it?
- Yes.

247
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,335
In fact, it's loose.

248
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,293
Yes, it looks good.

249
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:48,835
After our honeymoon, we had no idea
that Yashvi was on the way.

250
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:51,210
We didn't find out for a while.

251
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:54,210
We didn't find out for two months!

252
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:12,543
We didn't have much then.

253
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,335
When she arrived, our luck turned.

254
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:24,835
These days things are so expensive,
luck is not enough.

255
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,043
And why do you make cauliflower
every day?

256
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:29,710
Did you buy it in bulk?

257
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:43,668
Rajeev.

258
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:49,126
What if Yashvi
had a little brother or sister?

259
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,668
You had a brother.

260
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,793
And he...

261
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:02,960
Please don't make cauliflower every day,
it gives me gas.

262
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,543
Rickshaw, bus, airplane...

263
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,112
Everything gets stuck in Mumbai traffic.

264
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,460
This road has been jammed for hours.

265
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:16,585
You see that building? That tall tower.

266
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,126
A woman jumped off
along with her little girl this morning.

267
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,293
Jumped with her little girl?

268
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,668
Yes, she jumped.

269
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,668
What was her name?

270
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:34,751
How would I know, sir?
I'm not related to her.

271
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:40,793
Must be family problems.

272
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:44,251
Do you know someone in that building?

273
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,668
Is she completely dead?

274
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:18,543
<i>Hello.</i>

275
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:21,251
<i>This morning,
my husband went to work...</i>

276
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:23,835
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?

277
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,835
I'm busy, actually.

278
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:29,960
What about the training?

279
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:31,835
This is lunch time.

280
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:33,668
Please come back later.

281
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:44,876
Everybody told me
not to expect anything from you.

282
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,960
My name is Aslam Shaikh.
I am an orphan.

283
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:57,626
I gave myself this name.

284
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,229
I've taught myself everything I know.

285
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:04,335
And I will teach myself this job too.
That's all. Thank you very much.

286
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,543
Listen.

287
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,126
Come here.

288
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,960
You go to my desk.

289
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:25,168
There are files
from the Ahmedabad sector.

290
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:29,210
Calculate the amounts, prepare the pay
orders, and send them to Accounts.

291
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:31,668
Thank you very much, sir.

292
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,168
Okay.

293
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:35,085
Thank you so much, sir.

294
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:37,210
Sir, I'll be right back.

295
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:39,543
No, don't come back. You go work.

296
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:42,210
- Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir.
- Okay.

297
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:50,751
<i>This morning, my husband went to work
and Yashvi to school.</i>

298
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:54,501
<i>I switched on the radio,
the news was on.</i>

299
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:58,585
<i>When my brother died,
everyone said the same thing,</i>

300
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,793
<i>"He should have had courage.</i>

301
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:03,293
<i>"So what if he failed his exams?</i>

302
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:05,626
<i>"He should have had courage."</i>

303
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:09,376
<i>What went through
that woman's mind?</i>

304
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,960
<i>Perhaps she took off all her jewelry.</i>

305
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:16,876
<i>Bracelets, earrings...</i>

306
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,335
<i>her wedding necklace.</i>

307
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:23,251
<i>What did her daughter ask on the way?</i>

308
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:25,085
Mom, what are we going to play?

309
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:33,710
<i>It must have been so difficult
to get to the roof.</i>

310
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:40,668
<i>Doesn't it take courage
to jump from tall buildings?</i>

311
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:50,335
<i>Dear Ila, please don't think like that.</i>

312
00:39:50,418 --> 00:39:53,418
<i>Things are never as bad as they seem.</i>

313
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:56,876
<i>One day I was on the train
on my way to work.</i>

314
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,335
<i>And then suddenly I felt something.</i>

315
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:02,210
<i>Someone touching me.</i>

316
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:04,335
<i>Down there.</i>

317
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,793
Are you laughing?

318
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,543
Yes, Auntie.

319
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,543
I just remembered a joke.

320
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,418
Tell me the joke!

321
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,835
I forgot.

322
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:05,876
- You forgot?
- Yes.

323
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,668
Soak five almonds in water
every night

324
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:10,793
and eat them in the morning.

325
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,710
It's a tonic for memory.

326
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,543
I will right away, Auntie.

327
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:21,626
How are you, sir?

328
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:24,210
Going to the station?

329
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:25,543
Yes.

330
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,126
I get off at Bombay Central.

331
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:31,793
I live in Dongri.

332
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:34,501
- And you, sir?
- I live in Bandra.

333
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,668
Sir, can I ask you a question?

334
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,626
Yes.

335
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:53,168
People in the office say...

336
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:01,543
you were walking and kicked a cat.

337
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:06,418
It got hit by a bus

338
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:09,793
and you just went on your way.
Didn't even look back.

339
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:11,293
Is this true, sir?

340
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:16,585
Actually, it wasn't a cat.
It was a blind man.

341
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:20,626
He asked for directions
so I pushed him, and he got hit by a bus.

342
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:31,418
You better be careful.

343
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:35,960
Thank you.

344
00:42:39,335 --> 00:42:40,960
Give me a cigarette.

345
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,793
- I'll pay you later.
- Okay.

346
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,460
You're joking, right?

347
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,293
Have you always lived in Bandra?

348
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:58,126
Yes, always.

349
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:01,835
I keep moving around.

350
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:05,210
First I was at Muhammad Ali Road...

351
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:07,085
then I went to Dubai...

352
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,918
then to Saudi Arabia.

353
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:12,251
I used to keep going back and forth
from Saudi

354
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:16,335
but once I met Meherunissa
I never went back.

355
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:20,043
I cut the vegetables here

356
00:43:20,126 --> 00:43:23,376
so when I get home
I can just throw them in the pan.

357
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,043
Where did you learn
to cut vegetables like that?

358
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:28,793
I worked in a hotel in Saudi.

359
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:30,751
- A hotel?
- Yes.

360
00:43:30,835 --> 00:43:35,460
Cooking, room service,
cleaning, accounts.

361
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:36,960
All in one.

362
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:40,126
It's dry in Saudi.

363
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,626
There's no such thing
as entertainment there.

364
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,835
You pray, you work,
you pray, you work.

365
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:47,918
And nothing else.
Here I get some free time.

366
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:51,210
Now I cook and wait for Meherunissa.

367
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:53,626
She comes back in the evening.

368
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:56,251
We eat, then go for a walk.

369
00:43:56,335 --> 00:43:58,293
Very good.

370
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:04,085
But I love her, sir.
No matter what.

371
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:07,751
What do you do in the evenings?

372
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:12,293
I watch TV...

373
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:14,876
sometimes...

374
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,793
Sir, come with me.

375
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:28,460
- Where?
- My house.

376
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,085
I'll make pasandas for you.

377
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:35,376
- What?
- Pasanda.

378
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,126
- What is that?
- It's a special lamb dish...

379
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,126
that you chop like this.

380
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,835
- A lamb dish?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,835
And I'm a specialist.

382
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:48,543
Yes, I'll come.

383
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:50,335
- Come now.
- Today?

384
00:44:50,418 --> 00:44:51,960
Please come now!

385
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,793
I have some important work at home

386
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:59,251
but I'll come next time.

387
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:01,168
- For sure next time?
- Yes.

388
00:45:01,251 --> 00:45:02,626
Promise?

389
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,376
I'll be expecting you.

390
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,126
I'll come next time.

391
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,335
- Okay, sir. See you, bye.
- Bye-bye.

392
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:57,085
<i>Hello.</i>

393
00:45:57,168 --> 00:45:59,543
<i>My husband came home
late last night.</i>

394
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:01,960
<i>He got a call
and went back to work.</i>

395
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:03,960
<i>Yashvi fell asleep.</i>

396
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:08,835
<i>When I got married, I took some things
without telling my mother.</i>

397
00:46:09,543 --> 00:46:12,168
<i>Among those things
I found an old diary.</i>

398
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:17,335
<i>Grandma wrote all her recipes in it.
I found one for spring apples.</i>

399
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:19,126
<i>Spring apples are in season.</i>

400
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,543
<i>I think you will like it.</i>

401
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:25,293
Excellent.

402
00:46:25,835 --> 00:46:27,085
How are you, sir?

403
00:46:27,793 --> 00:46:28,835
Can I sit?

404
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,418
Sit.

405
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:33,626
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

406
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,793
Thank you very much.

407
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:41,001
Here.

408
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:43,210
Try.

409
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:44,626
Sure?

410
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,543
Yeah.

411
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:10,460
What happened?

412
00:47:13,668 --> 00:47:15,960
- Who made this?
- Why?

413
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:20,418
A restaurant near my house.

414
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:22,501
Why?

415
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:24,793
It's great.

416
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,126
Just great.
Sir, book a lunchbox for me as well.

417
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,501
It's shutting down soon.

418
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:33,501
But it has such great food!

419
00:47:34,543 --> 00:47:37,293
There's no value for talent
in this country.

420
00:47:40,126 --> 00:47:44,168
You're right, sir,
talent has no value in this country.

421
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:46,376
You need magic in the hands.

422
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,793
Anyone can make food
but you need magic.

423
00:48:04,668 --> 00:48:09,418
<i>Dear Ila, your grandmother's recipe
was very good.</i>

424
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:12,251
<i>Even better
than my favorite aubergines.</i>

425
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:15,460
<i>Yesterday even I found something
from many years ago.</i>

426
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:19,793
<i>I found old TV shows
that my wife used to record.</i>

427
00:48:20,876 --> 00:48:24,543
<i>You must have been a child when they
played on TV, or not even born yet.</i>

428
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,918
<i>My wife used to love them.</i>

429
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:37,085
<i>I don't know why I wanted to see them.</i>

430
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:39,293
<i>I watched them for hours.</i>

431
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,793
<i>I went through them show by show,
episode by episode.</i>

432
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:49,043
<i>And then finally, after staying up
all night...</i>

433
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,793
<i>I realized what it was
that I was looking for.</i>

434
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:55,585
<i>Every Sunday
when she watched the shows...</i>

435
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:59,210
<i>I was outside repairing my bicycle
or just smoking.</i>

436
00:48:59,293 --> 00:49:03,210
<i>And I would glance through the window
every now and then just for a second</i>

437
00:49:03,294 --> 00:49:06,668
<i>and I would see her reflection
on the TV screen.</i>

438
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:08,210
<i>Laughing.</i>

439
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:11,043
<i>Laughing at the same jokes
over and over.</i>

440
00:49:11,126 --> 00:49:14,418
<i>Each time as if she was hearing it
for the very first time.</i>

441
00:49:17,713 --> 00:49:21,585
<i>I wish I had kept on looking back then.</i>

442
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:34,501
I sent all the pay orders, sir.

443
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:41,293
An apple and a banana for you.

444
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:45,126
Okay. Have.

445
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,293
No, sir.

446
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:48,501
No, have.

447
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:51,793
- Have.
- Okay, sir.

448
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:02,293
- What is this?
- Sir, paper.

449
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:13,585
Could I have some water please?

450
00:50:16,668 --> 00:50:19,918
- How is it? Good?
- I love this.

451
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,668
Yeah. Thank you.

452
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:32,001
Nowadays everyone uses email,
not paper.

453
00:50:32,626 --> 00:50:35,376
- What paper?
- The letter.

454
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:38,460
We are in the era of email.

455
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:45,543
<i>Hello.</i>

456
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,543
<i>My mother loves the old TV shows.</i>

457
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:53,126
<i>When I was little
I would watch them with her for hours.</i>

458
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,793
<i>I wanted to tell you something.</i>

459
00:50:56,335 --> 00:50:59,418
<i>Every cigarette takes
five minutes off your life.</i>

460
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:01,335
<i>My father has lung cancer.</i>

461
00:51:02,002 --> 00:51:03,918
<i>When the pain is too much...</i>

462
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:06,793
<i>he says he should have smoked more...</i>

463
00:51:07,293 --> 00:51:09,668
<i>to avoid going through all this.</i>

464
00:51:10,905 --> 00:51:12,196
<i>Don't mind.</i>

465
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:02,960
Oh, Ila.

466
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,126
Yes, Auntie.

467
00:52:05,668 --> 00:52:07,501
Did you get my carrots?

468
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:09,876
Yes, here they are.

469
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:12,168
Here!

470
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,626
They only cost 10 rupees.

471
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:19,085
What else did you get?

472
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,876
The usual things, Auntie.

473
00:52:25,043 --> 00:52:28,668
<i>What's the other name
for "aubergine"?</i>

474
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:30,376
<i>"Eggplant."</i>

475
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,626
<i>It's vegetarian, so how come
it has "egg" in its name?</i>

476
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,085
He's on new medicine these days.

477
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:41,793
It helps...

478
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:44,335
but he sleeps all day.

479
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:51,710
Ma, where is the TV?

480
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:54,877
There are no good programs on TV
these days.

481
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,043
Do you need some money?

482
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:04,085
We're doing okay, child.

483
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:09,210
This new medicine
seems very expensive.

484
00:54:09,293 --> 00:54:13,335
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

485
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,502
How?

486
00:54:16,043 --> 00:54:17,627
Where will you get the money?

487
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:26,668
If my son were alive,
I wouldn't have to ask anyone for money.

488
00:54:31,078 --> 00:54:35,793
- I'll talk to Rajeev.
- No, no! There is no need.

489
00:54:39,127 --> 00:54:42,627
I'll arrange for about 5,000 for now.

490
00:54:43,335 --> 00:54:44,793
We're the girl's side.

491
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:48,085
Does it look nice?
Asking for money all the time?

492
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:53,252
It's fine, you can pay it back slowly.

493
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,668
No.

494
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:58,002
I have some money.

495
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,793
I can handle it.

496
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,627
Okay, fine.

497
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,543
But don't tell your father.

498
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,127
The 5,000 should cover
the cost of the medicine...

499
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:20,127
for this month.

500
00:55:21,335 --> 00:55:23,460
Next month something will turn up.

501
00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:35,043
Do you want to see him?
Shall I wake him?

502
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:39,085
It's late, we should go home.

503
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,293
Okay.

504
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:37,002
<i>Dear Ila, you won't believe
what happened to me yesterday.</i>

505
00:56:39,668 --> 00:56:42,460
<i>In the evening, as I was walking
to the station with Shaikh--</i>

506
00:56:42,543 --> 00:56:45,543
<i>Shaikh and I, we work together.</i>

507
00:56:45,627 --> 00:56:48,710
<i>I felt like stopping to look at
a painter's works.</i>

508
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:52,460
<i>All his paintings are exactly the same.</i>

509
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:55,543
<i>But when you look close, real close...</i>

510
00:56:55,627 --> 00:56:59,877
<i>you can see that they are different.
Each slightly different from the other.</i>

511
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,043
<i>A different car here, a different man
daydreaming on the bus there.</i>

512
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:06,377
<i>A stray dog
gallantly crossing the street.</i>

513
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,127
<i>Whatever catches the painter's fancy
on that day.</i>

514
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:13,835
<i>And in one of them, I saw myself.</i>

515
00:57:15,002 --> 00:57:16,918
<i>At least I think it's me.</i>

516
00:57:18,377 --> 00:57:21,127
<i>And then I treated myself
to an auto rickshaw.</i>

517
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:27,043
<i>The old houses of boys I used to play with
when I was a child are gone now.</i>

518
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:29,252
<i>My old school too.</i>

519
00:57:30,668 --> 00:57:33,418
<i>But some things are still the same.</i>

520
00:57:34,377 --> 00:57:36,752
<i>The old post office, still there.</i>

521
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:42,752
<i>And the hospital where I was born
and where my parents died. And my wife.</i>

522
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:50,085
<i>I think we forget things
if we have no one to tell them to.</i>

523
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:52,918
Did you say something, sir?

524
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,127
What?

525
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,960
Did you say something?

526
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,210
No.

527
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,752
What are you playing?

528
00:58:15,335 --> 00:58:16,793
Blind Man's Bluff.

529
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,543
Can I tell you what we used to play?

530
00:58:23,627 --> 00:58:24,918
What?

531
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,127
Look.

532
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:29,002
Let's untie this first.

533
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:30,668
Should I do it?

534
00:58:31,627 --> 00:58:33,127
I'll do it.

535
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:40,543
We used to play house.

536
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:46,377
This was the baby.

537
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,252
I was the father.

538
00:58:48,335 --> 00:58:51,752
And your uncle
used to play the mother...

539
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,918
My wife.

540
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:49,918
<i>Hello.</i>

541
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:52,627
<i>I want to tell you something.</i>

542
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,793
<i>My husband is having an affair.</i>

543
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:59,710
<i>I thought I should confront him,
but I don't have the courage.</i>

544
00:59:59,793 --> 01:00:01,460
<i>Where would I go?</i>

545
01:00:02,793 --> 01:00:04,543
<i>There is one place.</i>

546
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:09,127
<i>My daughter learned in school
that in Bhutan everyone is happy.</i>

547
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:13,793
<i>They don't have Gross Domestic Product,
only Gross National Happiness.</i>

548
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,460
<i>What if we had that here?</i>

549
01:01:01,877 --> 01:01:03,293
Madam.

550
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:34,793
WHAT IF I CAME TO
BHUTAN WITH YOU?

551
01:01:37,877 --> 01:01:40,710
You look very distracted today, sir.

552
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,710
- Did I do anything wrong?
- No.

553
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,668
Tell me something, Shaikh.

554
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:54,835
Yes, sir.

555
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:58,377
Have you... ever been to Bhutan?

556
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,627
Bhutan?

557
01:02:01,543 --> 01:02:05,752
I was thinking instead of Nashik,
I could settle in Bhutan.

558
01:02:07,418 --> 01:02:09,710
I've only been to Saudi.

559
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:12,127
Bhutan is good as well.

560
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:16,585
The economy is down there,
one rupee here is five there.

561
01:02:17,418 --> 01:02:19,043
So one can go there.

562
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:23,793
My mother always used to say...

563
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,960
Always says,

564
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:29,627
"Sometimes the wrong train
will get you to the right station."

565
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:33,502
Your mother says?

566
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:40,168
But you told me you were an orphan.

567
01:02:40,252 --> 01:02:41,960
I am, sir,

568
01:02:42,043 --> 01:02:46,002
but when I say "my mother always says"
people take it more seriously.

569
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:47,793
And it feels good.

570
01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:56,960
Right.

571
01:03:08,627 --> 01:03:12,252
<i>You are listening to Radio Bhutan...</i>

572
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:49,127
<i>How can we go to Bhutan together?</i>

573
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:51,252
<i>I don't even know your name.</i>

574
01:04:04,793 --> 01:04:06,377
How are you, sir?

575
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,127
A banana and apple.

576
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,668
Here, try this.

577
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:24,502
Here, taste this.

578
01:04:24,585 --> 01:04:27,377
You are glowing today, sir.

579
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,335
What is it?

580
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,752
You look 10 years younger.

581
01:04:45,043 --> 01:04:47,252
Your mother says,

582
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,877
"The wrong train
will get you to the right station."

583
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:55,002
Mother is always right, sir.

584
01:04:55,086 --> 01:04:57,960
- How is it?
- I love this.

585
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,627
- Variety.
- Variety, sir.

586
01:05:16,335 --> 01:05:17,793
Auntie.

587
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:22,460
Auntie.

588
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,127
Yes, what?

589
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,960
Auntie...

590
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:30,918
Do you have a tape
of that movie Saajan?

591
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:33,752
Yes, why?

592
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,043
The songs were good, right?

593
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:39,627
They're okay.

594
01:05:43,627 --> 01:05:45,127
Could we listen to it?

595
01:05:45,752 --> 01:05:47,085
Now?

596
01:05:49,127 --> 01:05:50,502
Yes.

597
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:52,127
Can you play it?

598
01:05:53,668 --> 01:05:55,127
I'll play it.

599
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:04,877
<i>Hello.</i>

600
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,668
<i>Yesterday, Auntie played this tape</i>

601
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:10,793
<i>of the movie</i> Saajan.
<i>A strange coincidence.</i>

602
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:14,377
<i>She has every Hindi movie
audio tape.</i>

603
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,293
<i>She doesn't have a CD
or MP3 player.</i>

604
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,752
<i>She keeps the cassette industry
alive all by herself.</i>

605
01:07:21,668 --> 01:07:23,543
<i>You must be trying to figure out...</i>

606
01:07:24,043 --> 01:07:26,502
<i>what I scratched out.</i>

607
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,210
<i>Isn't it odd to keep writing like this?</i>

608
01:07:32,002 --> 01:07:35,793
<i>We can write anything in a letter,
it's very easy.</i>

609
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:38,252
<i>But this...</i>

610
01:07:38,335 --> 01:07:40,543
<i>I can tell you only in person.</i>

611
01:07:41,793 --> 01:07:44,418
<i>I think it's time for us to meet.</i>

612
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:48,668
<i>Do you know the Kooler Café...</i>

613
01:07:48,752 --> 01:07:50,127
<i>in Matunga?</i>

614
01:07:50,918 --> 01:07:53,585
<i>I've heard
they have very good kheema pao.</i>

615
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:55,668
<i>My favorite.</i>

616
01:07:55,752 --> 01:07:57,710
<i>Shall we meet tomorrow?</i>

617
01:07:57,793 --> 01:07:58,960
<i>At 1:00?</i>

618
01:07:59,918 --> 01:08:01,293
<i>Ila.</i>

619
01:08:58,835 --> 01:08:59,960
What?

620
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:01,877
The boss wants to see you.

621
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:04,168
Yes, I'll come after lunch.

622
01:09:04,252 --> 01:09:05,668
It's urgent.

623
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,543
Okay, I'll come.

624
01:09:25,502 --> 01:09:27,127
- May I come in, sir?
- Come in.

625
01:09:44,877 --> 01:09:47,710
I just had a meeting
with the Accounts Department.

626
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:51,377
And it was the most embarrassing
meeting of my life.

627
01:09:53,062 --> 01:09:54,793
You know what they said?

628
01:09:55,877 --> 01:10:00,793
They said, "It's as if our Claims
Department does not exist."

629
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,668
All the pay orders are wrong.

630
01:10:05,752 --> 01:10:08,793
Shaikh's initials are all over the place.

631
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:13,127
And to think that I was going to have
this man replace you.

632
01:10:16,835 --> 01:10:18,960
I need you to review this.

633
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,793
Stay up all night if necessary,
but fix it.

634
01:10:23,668 --> 01:10:26,710
And as for you, Shaikh,
just get out of my sight. Please.

635
01:10:26,793 --> 01:10:28,585
It's my mistake, sir.

636
01:10:29,627 --> 01:10:31,543
I made the pay orders.

637
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,289
I asked his initials
because we work together.

638
01:10:36,335 --> 01:10:38,043
It's my mistake.

639
01:10:38,127 --> 01:10:39,460
Fernandes...

640
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:43,002
- you don't have to defend him.
- I'm not defending anyone, sir.

641
01:10:45,752 --> 01:10:48,043
Thirty-five years of service.

642
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:50,793
And you have not made
one single mistake.

643
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:54,085
You know I would not
defend anyone, sir.

644
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:58,460
Anyway...

645
01:11:00,492 --> 01:11:02,335
I'll handle the Accounts Department.

646
01:11:02,418 --> 01:11:05,377
- Okay?
- It's okay, sir, no problem.

647
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:11,210
One more thing.

648
01:11:11,752 --> 01:11:14,627
Why do these files all smell
of vegetables?

649
01:11:16,601 --> 01:11:20,335
- Onions, potatoes, even garlic.
- Really?

650
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:22,877
Smell it. Smell it.

651
01:11:25,218 --> 01:11:26,627
I don't...

652
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,460
Sorry, sir, you saved me today.

653
01:11:55,293 --> 01:11:56,960
Thank you, sir, you saved me.

654
01:11:57,043 --> 01:12:00,460
Don't you ever cut your bloody vegetables
on the office files.

655
01:12:02,043 --> 01:12:03,418
Sorry, sir.

656
01:12:04,502 --> 01:12:05,585
Next time...

657
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:10,127
I'll put a plastic bag over the files.
And then cut the vegetables.

658
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,543
I'm sorry, sir.

659
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:16,543
I'm sorry, sir, no vegetables. Nothing.

660
01:12:16,627 --> 01:12:18,002
I'm sorry, sir.

661
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:22,918
This isn't some cheap restaurant in Saudi!

662
01:12:23,002 --> 01:12:24,543
These are government records!

663
01:12:24,627 --> 01:12:25,835
Do you understand?

664
01:12:31,585 --> 01:12:33,668
If you cannot do this, get lost!

665
01:12:34,793 --> 01:12:37,460
Why should I get lost?

666
01:12:38,835 --> 01:12:40,543
You will teach me.

667
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:43,918
I am sorry, sir, but you will teach me!

668
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:53,418
Did your mother also tell you
to forge a degree to get a job?

669
01:12:56,252 --> 01:12:58,918
She must have gotten confused.

670
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:04,460
What kind of a person you are, Mr Shaikh?

671
01:13:11,377 --> 01:13:15,002
Why don't you come over
for dinner, sir?

672
01:13:15,585 --> 01:13:17,460
I've made pasandas.

673
01:13:18,415 --> 01:13:19,418
Sir, please.

674
01:13:25,793 --> 01:13:29,085
Unbelievable, Mr Shaikh.

675
01:13:30,418 --> 01:13:32,168
Unbelievable.

676
01:13:36,668 --> 01:13:38,377
Pasanda, he says.

677
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,418
You'll come, right?

678
01:13:47,127 --> 01:13:49,502
- Sir, have more pasandas.
- No, no, no.

679
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:52,043
It's very good.

680
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,002
It's my recipe, sir.

681
01:13:54,085 --> 01:13:55,543
My father warned me,

682
01:13:55,627 --> 01:13:58,543
"Don't marry him,
he'll chain you to the stove."

683
01:13:58,627 --> 01:14:00,390
Her father is a very dangerous man.

684
01:14:01,127 --> 01:14:03,085
Last time he smiled

685
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:06,127
was during the 1984 World Cup.

686
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,793
Just a little bit.

687
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:13,127
He's a sour face.

688
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:20,210
Sir, what does your wife do?

689
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:21,585
Be quiet.

690
01:14:22,293 --> 01:14:24,377
I'm sorry, sir, she doesn't know.

691
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,752
It's okay.

692
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:31,127
My wife has passed away.

693
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,418
But I have a girlfriend.

694
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:46,085
You?

695
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:49,460
Yes.

696
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:58,627
What is her name?

697
01:15:11,127 --> 01:15:12,335
Ila.

698
01:15:15,918 --> 01:15:17,418
I knew it, sir!

699
01:15:17,502 --> 01:15:20,460
The lunchbox, the notes...

700
01:15:20,543 --> 01:15:22,877
When did you get married?

701
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,710
Marriage, sir...
Sometimes it feels like 35 years.

702
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:32,668
Sometimes 25, or 10, and sometimes
it feels like it was yesterday.

703
01:15:35,752 --> 01:15:39,960
Sir, you're not eating, have some more.

704
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,043
It's my recipe, sir.

705
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:43,543
I really don't want it.

706
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:45,252
You're not eating at all.

707
01:15:50,127 --> 01:15:52,752
Sir, I wanted to ask you something.

708
01:15:52,835 --> 01:15:54,460
Go ahead.

709
01:15:56,877 --> 01:16:00,127
You asked just now
when we got married.

710
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,877
Actually...

711
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,793
her father said no.

712
01:16:07,793 --> 01:16:11,793
He said, "The boy is an orphan,
short and dark-skinned."

713
01:16:15,793 --> 01:16:20,460
So Meherunissa ran away from home.

714
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:28,918
But she doesn't want to get married
without her father's blessing.

715
01:16:31,127 --> 01:16:32,752
I won't tell anyone.

716
01:16:32,835 --> 01:16:34,460
No. It's not that.

717
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:37,085
Her father has agreed now.

718
01:16:38,502 --> 01:16:40,293
We are getting married soon.

719
01:16:46,293 --> 01:16:49,210
There'll be an army from her side
at the wedding.

720
01:16:49,293 --> 01:16:52,460
Brothers and sisters,
their husbands, children...

721
01:16:53,127 --> 01:16:56,960
uncles, aunts,
everyone will be there.

722
01:16:57,668 --> 01:17:00,627
And there is no one from my side.

723
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,127
I'm alone.

724
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:07,835
I wanted to ask, if you wouldn't mind...

725
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:13,002
being the witness from my side.

726
01:17:13,627 --> 01:17:14,627
My "guardian."

727
01:17:16,293 --> 01:17:17,293
Me?

728
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,418
Yes, and if Madam Ila can come too...

729
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,710
Of course.

730
01:17:28,752 --> 01:17:31,377
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

731
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,335
Thank you so much, sir.

732
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:37,793
Her father insists
on giving me a scooter.

733
01:17:37,877 --> 01:17:39,668
As a gift for my promotion.

734
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:42,502
But I'm not retiring.

735
01:17:44,585 --> 01:17:45,627
I was thinking...

736
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,543
of not taking early retirement.

737
01:17:50,543 --> 01:17:54,168
I'll ask the boss
to make you my assistant.

738
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:56,335
So your promotion...

739
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,460
That's good news, sir!

740
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:04,627
I mean, great news!

741
01:18:07,793 --> 01:18:11,293
Don't mention it to my father-in-law,
he'll take the scooter back.

742
01:18:12,085 --> 01:18:13,752
Sir, please.

743
01:18:13,835 --> 01:18:17,002
I'll tell Meherunissa the good news.

744
01:18:19,104 --> 01:18:20,585
Thank you very much, sir.

745
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:53,210
Uncle, would you like to sit?

746
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:54,918
Who, me?

747
01:19:55,002 --> 01:19:56,877
Yes, Uncle, would you like to sit?

748
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,002
No.

749
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:01,460
Please, I'm getting off
at the next station.

750
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:30,793
Fernandes.

751
01:20:30,877 --> 01:20:33,293
- Yes, sir.
- You wanted to talk to me?

752
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,210
No, sir.

753
01:20:35,293 --> 01:20:38,127
My secretary said
you wanted to talk to me.

754
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:40,627
It was about pay orders.

755
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:44,043
What about the pay orders?

756
01:20:44,127 --> 01:20:45,918
I solved it.

757
01:20:46,002 --> 01:20:48,085
- You sure?
- Yeah.

758
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,168
Okay.

759
01:20:51,252 --> 01:20:52,960
- I'll see you soon.
- Yes, sir.

760
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:22,293
Would you like to order?

761
01:22:00,043 --> 01:22:01,877
<i>Let's move to architecture now.</i>

762
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,085
<i>New services keep on coming out
and keep on getting close.</i>

763
01:22:05,168 --> 01:22:09,252
<i>Let's see if any one of them
can perhaps be a little easier to use.</i>

764
01:23:13,168 --> 01:23:18,002
<i>Dear Ila, I got the lunchbox today.
There was nothing in it.</i>

765
01:23:18,085 --> 01:23:20,466
<i>And I deserve that.</i>

766
01:23:22,168 --> 01:23:26,210
<i>Yesterday you waited in the restaurant
for me for a long time.</i>

767
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:32,778
<i>But before that, that same morning
I forgot something in the bathroom.</i>

768
01:23:33,918 --> 01:23:36,543
<i>I went back in to get it.</i>

769
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:39,377
<i>And the bathroom smelled the same.</i>

770
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:44,293
<i>Exactly the same as it used to be after
my grandfather had been in the shower.</i>

771
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:48,918
<i>It was like my grandfather
had been there.</i>

772
01:23:49,668 --> 01:23:51,460
<i>But he had not.</i>

773
01:23:51,543 --> 01:23:53,335
<i>It was just me.</i>

774
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:57,293
<i>Just me and the smell of an old man.</i>

775
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:00,799
<i>I don't know when I became old.</i>

776
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:06,585
<i>Maybe it was that morning.
Maybe it was many, many mornings ago.</i>

777
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,877
<i>And maybe if I'd forgotten something
in the bathroom before,</i>

778
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,043
<i>I would have found out sooner.</i>

779
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:15,418
Uncle, would you like a seat?

780
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:17,543
No, no.

781
01:24:20,585 --> 01:24:24,043
<i>Life kept on going and lulled me
with its motions.</i>

782
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:28,960
<i>I kept rocking back and forth
as it threw me left and threw me right.</i>

783
01:24:29,043 --> 01:24:31,002
<i>And then before I knew it...</i>

784
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:35,877
<i>No one buys
yesterday's lottery ticket, Ila.</i>

785
01:24:36,877 --> 01:24:40,002
<i>I came to the restaurant
while you were waiting.</i>

786
01:24:41,963 --> 01:24:43,460
<i>There you were.</i>

787
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:45,835
<i>Fidgeting with your purse.</i>

788
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:47,835
<i>Drinking all that water.</i>

789
01:24:56,398 --> 01:24:59,460
<i>I wanted to come up to you
and tell you all this in person</i>

790
01:24:59,543 --> 01:25:01,793
<i>but I just watched you wait.</i>

791
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:07,960
<i>You looked beautiful.</i>

792
01:25:12,627 --> 01:25:13,807
<i>You're young.</i>

793
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:16,460
<i>You can dream.</i>

794
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:20,502
<i>And for some time,
you let me into your dreams.</i>

795
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:26,793
<i>And I want to thank you for that.</i>

796
01:26:07,793 --> 01:26:11,234
The two ladies at the back
please come in front. I can't see you.

797
01:26:15,085 --> 01:26:16,543
Smile, please.

798
01:26:17,127 --> 01:26:19,127
One, two, three.

799
01:26:19,877 --> 01:26:21,668
Now a photo with everyone!

800
01:26:21,752 --> 01:26:25,127
The girl's side to the right.
The boy's side to the left please.

801
01:26:32,877 --> 01:26:35,793
The boy's side to the left please.

802
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:42,960
Smile, please.

803
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:56,210
You're leaving, sir?

804
01:26:57,752 --> 01:26:59,210
This is the new scooter?

805
01:26:59,293 --> 01:27:00,793
Want a lift?

806
01:27:02,793 --> 01:27:04,543
If you stay and don't retire,

807
01:27:04,627 --> 01:27:06,960
I'll return it to Meherunissa's father.

808
01:27:09,293 --> 01:27:10,460
Taxi!

809
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:14,668
The weather is strange.

810
01:27:14,752 --> 01:27:16,960
It's like there's a drought.

811
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:25,877
Okay.

812
01:27:29,085 --> 01:27:30,460
Goodbye, Shaikh.

813
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:38,085
Do you know, sir...

814
01:27:38,168 --> 01:27:41,793
the first time I took the train
with you, in first class...

815
01:27:42,627 --> 01:27:44,543
I hadn't bought a ticket.

816
01:27:46,085 --> 01:27:48,835
I spent the whole journey
till Bombay Central...

817
01:27:49,335 --> 01:27:51,460
praying I wouldn't be caught.

818
01:27:51,543 --> 01:27:53,543
What would you have thought of me?

819
01:27:58,168 --> 01:28:01,418
But the very next day,
I got a first class pass made.

820
01:28:16,502 --> 01:28:19,127
You'll be a good husband, Shaikh.

821
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,210
Thank you very much, sir.

822
01:28:30,627 --> 01:28:31,793
Wait.

823
01:28:39,752 --> 01:28:41,460
Come to Nashik sometime.

824
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:28,793
Hello.

825
01:29:32,085 --> 01:29:33,293
Ma...

826
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,877
I'm coming.

827
01:29:52,793 --> 01:29:54,002
Eighty rupees.

828
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:25,002
Rajeev is on his way.

829
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:27,960
He's in a meeting.

830
01:30:28,502 --> 01:30:30,793
He'll go straight to the crematorium.

831
01:30:38,502 --> 01:30:40,543
I'm very hungry.

832
01:30:42,835 --> 01:30:45,210
I'm craving parathas.

833
01:30:49,627 --> 01:30:52,127
I didn't eat breakfast this morning.

834
01:30:53,293 --> 01:30:55,460
I was making breakfast for him.

835
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,293
Okay, Ma.

836
01:31:02,335 --> 01:31:04,960
I was always worried...

837
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:09,752
about what would happen to me
when he passed away.

838
01:31:12,293 --> 01:31:14,043
- Never mind.
- But now...

839
01:31:16,127 --> 01:31:18,835
I just feel hungry.

840
01:31:22,348 --> 01:31:23,668
Ma.

841
01:31:26,335 --> 01:31:27,835
In the beginning...

842
01:31:28,835 --> 01:31:31,127
there was a lot of love between us...

843
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:33,960
when you were born.

844
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:37,293
But for several years...

845
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:43,002
I've been disgusted by him.

846
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:46,127
Ma.

847
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:49,877
- Every morning, his breakfast...
- Ma.

848
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:52,710
...his medicine, his bath,

849
01:31:52,793 --> 01:31:56,460
breakfast, medicine, bath...

850
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:08,502
When your brother died...

851
01:32:12,156 --> 01:32:15,210
that old ambulance
with a red light came.

852
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:16,543
Remember?

853
01:32:20,127 --> 01:32:22,418
Those old Matador models.

854
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:25,752
Which one has come now?

855
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:30,127
What color?

856
01:32:31,518 --> 01:32:32,668
White.

857
01:32:33,627 --> 01:32:35,668
With the blue light.

858
01:32:35,752 --> 01:32:37,627
Okay.

859
01:32:57,127 --> 01:32:58,627
Mister.

860
01:32:58,710 --> 01:32:59,918
Yes.

861
01:33:00,502 --> 01:33:03,460
This lunchbox is going
to the wrong address.

862
01:33:03,543 --> 01:33:05,481
How can it go to the wrong address?

863
01:33:06,293 --> 01:33:07,752
We don't deliver it wrong.

864
01:33:07,835 --> 01:33:10,793
Yes, I understand.

865
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:16,377
But my lunchbox has not been going
to the right address.

866
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,793
- It goes to the right address.
- It doesn't.

867
01:33:18,877 --> 01:33:20,585
People from Harvard came...

868
01:33:20,668 --> 01:33:22,752
Forget about them.

869
01:33:22,835 --> 01:33:25,877
Listen to me.
Try to understand what I'm saying.

870
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,668
This lunchbox that I give to you
does not go to my husband.

871
01:33:29,752 --> 01:33:33,877
Instead it goes to someone else,
who has been eating it.

872
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:37,585
The Harvard people came here
and studied our system.

873
01:33:37,668 --> 01:33:41,918
- They said we don't deliver wrong...
- It's been going to the wrong address.

874
01:33:42,002 --> 01:33:43,835
Do you think I am a liar?

875
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:47,793
The King of England came in person
to see our system.

876
01:33:47,877 --> 01:33:50,710
But this lunchbox is going somewhere.

877
01:33:50,793 --> 01:33:52,502
It goes to the right building.

878
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:55,502
I want the address of that building!

879
01:34:21,293 --> 01:34:22,793
Saajan Fernandes' desk?

880
01:34:22,877 --> 01:34:25,460
He sits two desks down.

881
01:34:37,627 --> 01:34:40,002
Is this Saajan Fernandes' desk?

882
01:34:41,543 --> 01:34:42,877
Let me call you back.

883
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,918
Saajan Fernandes?

884
01:34:45,002 --> 01:34:46,627
He left.

885
01:34:47,252 --> 01:34:50,127
I mean he left the job.

886
01:34:50,877 --> 01:34:52,335
Where can I find him?

887
01:34:52,418 --> 01:34:53,543
Nashik.

888
01:34:55,085 --> 01:34:56,668
He left for Nashik.

889
01:35:05,835 --> 01:35:08,210
So you are going to Nashik?

890
01:35:08,293 --> 01:35:09,335
Yes.

891
01:35:11,377 --> 01:35:13,293
Are you moving there?

892
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:16,335
Yes.

893
01:35:17,335 --> 01:35:19,085
Permanently?

894
01:35:20,668 --> 01:35:21,793
Yes.

895
01:35:26,668 --> 01:35:29,002
I retired three years ago.

896
01:35:29,085 --> 01:35:31,543
I come back to see my son
every now and then.

897
01:36:12,697 --> 01:36:13,877
Sorry, Ila, ma'am.

898
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:39,752
Throw.

899
01:36:41,668 --> 01:36:42,960
Come on, Calvin.

900
01:37:00,585 --> 01:37:03,877
- Good evening, Mr Fernandes.
- We thought that you're gone.

901
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,377
I was gone.

902
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,710
- But I came back.
- Why?

903
01:37:16,502 --> 01:37:21,752
Okay, you play here,
but don't break anybody's glass.

904
01:37:21,835 --> 01:37:23,418
Okay?

905
01:37:23,502 --> 01:37:24,918
Take it.

906
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,877
Thank you, Mr Fernandes.

907
01:37:32,793 --> 01:37:35,335
- Come on, Calvin.
- Come on, Calvin.

908
01:37:47,918 --> 01:37:49,627
Ila?

909
01:37:50,418 --> 01:37:51,543
Ila?

910
01:37:52,418 --> 01:37:54,377
Auntie.

911
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:57,043
I've been calling out
since this afternoon.

912
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,710
Where were you?

913
01:37:59,793 --> 01:38:02,460
I had something to take care of.

914
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,127
I got worried.

915
01:38:05,293 --> 01:38:10,335
I ran out of diapers for your uncle.

916
01:38:10,418 --> 01:38:12,960
But I asked the super to get them.

917
01:38:13,793 --> 01:38:14,918
Do you know, Ila?

918
01:38:15,002 --> 01:38:17,335
I cleaned your uncle's fan today.

919
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,877
Without turning it off!

920
01:40:13,293 --> 01:40:15,418
<i>You must have reached Nashik.</i>

921
01:40:16,085 --> 01:40:19,002
<i>This morning you probably woke up
and made some tea.</i>

922
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:24,002
<i>And after that
maybe you went for a morning walk.</i>

923
01:40:25,835 --> 01:40:27,752
<i>I woke up this morning</i>

924
01:40:27,835 --> 01:40:29,793
<i>and sold all my jewelry.</i>

925
01:40:30,793 --> 01:40:34,127
<i>My bracelets, earrings
and my wedding necklace.</i>

926
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,293
<i>It's not much.</i>

927
01:40:36,835 --> 01:40:39,210
<i>But I've heard that one rupee here</i>

928
01:40:39,293 --> 01:40:41,543
<i>is worth five in Bhutan.</i>

929
01:40:41,627 --> 01:40:44,085
<i>So maybe we'll be okay for some time.</i>

930
01:40:44,168 --> 01:40:45,627
<i>And after that...</i>

931
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:49,793
<i>After that, we'll see.</i>

932
01:40:51,127 --> 01:40:54,877
<i>By the time Yashvi comes home
from school, I'll have packed.</i>

933
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,085
<i>And we'll take the afternoon train.</i>

934
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,543
<i>Maybe I'll send you this letter</i>

935
01:41:00,627 --> 01:41:03,127
<i>and your new postman will deliver it.</i>

936
01:41:04,005 --> 01:41:06,835
<i>Or maybe I should keep it for myself.</i>

937
01:41:07,543 --> 01:41:09,877
<i>And read it again years from now.</i>

938
01:41:11,737 --> 01:41:13,293
<i>I read somewhere...</i>

939
01:41:14,627 --> 01:41:18,067
<i>that sometimes the wrong train
will get you to the right station.</i>

940
01:41:19,653 --> 01:41:20,877
<i>Let's see.</i>
