What is life? A manifest order between the elements
What is death? A confusion thrown between these elements

3
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,961
- Ah yes. Wait a moment.

4
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,591
I have a gift for you.

5
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,221
- Thank you.

6
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,132
- What?

7
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,012
- I don't know, it makes me a little weird.

8
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,356
- Open the door !

9
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,484
What the hell are you doing in there? Open!

10
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,743
Open!

11
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,161
Ah !

12
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,579
Look at me there.

13
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,498
It feels like a love hotel.

14
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,293
- Please ... - Come over here.

15
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,587
Go!

16
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,340
- We take their identity. Your name !

17
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,883
Your name !

18
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,176
- Piyush Agarwal.

19
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,054
- What are you doing ? - I'm a student, sir.

20
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,263
- Where do you live?

21
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,059
- Allahabad. - "Allahabad." Are you studying anatomy?

22
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:54,605
- Sir, can't we agree on a settlement?? 
- Tiwari, show him good "settlement".

23
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,107
I'll make arrangements with the young lady.

24
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,694
- Hey! What's your name ?

25
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,571
What's your name ?

26
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:03,989
- Please ...

27
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,116
Say it!
- Devi

28
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,410
Devi, your life is now ruined

29
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,039
Piyush!
- Catch him!

30
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,625
Bring him back here.

31
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,544
- I thought you wanted us to work it out.

32
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,797
- What do you want ?

33
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,090
I am a student.

34
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,592
This is the first time I have done this.

35
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,220
- Start by opening the door. Go!

36
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,225
Open!

37
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,189
- We're digging.

38
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,441
Find me his wallet.

39
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,151
- You're going to open up, you little asshole!

40
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,739
What the hell is he doing? Open that door!

41
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,367
- So you found him? - Get out!

42
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,619
- I'll get it out for you.

43
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,415
Father's name: Ramdhari Agarwal

44
00:06:54,581 --> 00:07:00,170
Phone number: 94-15-25-75-47.

45
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,381
You have 2 min to get out of there,

46
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,968
Otherwise I call your father. 
- I have to go to the bathroom.

47
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,388
- You'll shit in jail. Your dad's phone is busy.

48
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,767
- Have a pity, don't tell my father. 
- I'm going to embarrass myself, here.

49
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,395
Where are you from? From the whore district?

50
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,021
- Look at him !

51
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,316
- No. 
- Are you imported from Nepal?

52
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,693
- You are wrong.

53
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,903
- Is that so ? Are we wrong?

54
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,076
If you don't open, we'll drag you naked in the street!

55
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,244
Open!

56
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,249
What are you waiting for ? Break open the damn door!

57
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,625
- You're going to open!

58
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,960
Open!

59
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,549
Are you going to open up, you little asshole? 
You will open, yes or shit!

60
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,217
- Break down that door!

61
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,725
Are you at a confessional?

62
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,602
Chief ! - What?

63
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,104
- Come see what he did. - Piyush!

64
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,814
- What's the matter ?

65
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,902
Hey Pandev!
Call the ambulance

66
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,737
- Piyush...

67
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,619
Slowly slowly.

68
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,248
Raise his arm. Piss the blood.

69
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,834
Is the ambulance coming?

70
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,725
Janaki, get her dressed, we'll get her on board.

71
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,195
What are you looking at ? Unleash!

72
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,866
Move around!

73
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,355
- Ah! Here is my son.

74
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,566
I'll bring you a glass of water.

75
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,652
- I'll help myself. - I'll take care of it, mother-in-law.

76
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,153
- Okay. Go ahead.

77
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,788
- We must light the stove.

78
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:44,042
- My son, go get a fire. You have to light the stove.

79
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:49,590
Wake up your big brother, by the way. 
He's gonna be late for the funeral.

80
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,633
Brother!

81
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,552
Brother!

82
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,596
Sikandar...

83
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,598
Hi, Brother! !

84
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,100
Get up. Mom told me to wake you up.

85
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,311
Come on, get up. Standing.

86
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,176
Dad, I'll light the stove and be back 
- What about Sikandar?

87
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,637
- I woke him up, he's coming.

88
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,483
- Hi, Motilal !

89
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,653
Come, have some sweets.
-I can't leave my shop unattended

90
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,197
- So what ? Like every day. 
Nobody's going to steal anything

91
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,825
They brought this to us, they are students. Tell him.

92
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,995
- We are doing research in anthropology.

93
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,623
- They are interested 
in the history of the ghats (cremating site).

94
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,124
Tell them. - Me ?

95
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,168
You are the specialist.

96
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,712
- And you, the alley specialist.

97
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,589
- The badly frequented alleys.

98
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,717
You're recording this?

99
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,179
- Yes, sir. 
One tends to miss details while writing

100
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,265
History... Huh?

101
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,353
Before, on this shore, 
it was the forest as far as the eye can see.

102
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,688
The Ganges is sacred.

103
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,817
People brought their dead, 
for the ritual of cremation.

104
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,987
The Maharajahs built gahts.

105
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,282
Now there are different priests there,

106
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,617
different customs,

107
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:44,204
different castes and different funeral rites.

108
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,914
You see ?

109
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,959
The ghat on which we are, for example,

110
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,086
is a hotly contested location.

111
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,671
- Like Kashmir. - Yes.

112
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,298
The people of Bombay claim it.

113
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,677
The people of Gujarat also claim it.

114
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,346
Do you agree? What are we going to do with him?

115
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,765
He's little Jhonta, a hell of a trickster.

116
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,227
Later he will study, but he brought me no clients.

117
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,063
Not a pilgrim since this morning. 

118
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,064
- I go.

119
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,650
Bring me the phone. Hurry up.

120
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,946
Another example, the Scindya ghat, a little further away ...

121
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,948
Hey! - I'm bringing back pilgrims.

122
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,659
- It's not true. Kids today ...

123
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,287
They are smarter than us. - That is true.

124
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:29,207
- And that damn phone ... It keeps ringing.

125
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,752
A real calamity, this invention.

126
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:33,879
Yes, hello?

127
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,923
It's me, yes.

128
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,425
What ?

129
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,428
- She prepared her action well. She put on a saree,

130
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,555
got a red dot on her forehead.

131
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,849
They had only seen each other twice,

132
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,225
and there we go!

133
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,895
How does she explain that?

134
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,815
I'm talking to you.

135
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,902
Repeat what you told me. Come on, tell him.

136
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,361
Tell your father.

137
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,741
How do you explain it? Ah yes, it was "out of curiosity".

138
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,952
lf l tip off a journalist...

139
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,412
Count on them.

140
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,248
It will make the headlines. 
What is this?

141
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,543
A file of another department,
on my desk?

142
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,256
Whatever ! Who gave me such incompetents?

143
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,217
Bring me the right file!

144
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,345
Your name ?

145
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,847
- Pathak.

146
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,019
Vidhyadhar Pathak.

147
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,025
I help the pilgrims to perform the rituals on Nandeshwar ghat.

148
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,696
I was teaching Sanskrit at the university.

149
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:43,782
I translate...

150
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,785
- You will be summoned in 3 days.

151
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,954
Pay the bail here

152
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,748
and take your daughter for now

153
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,835
- Sorry, Mr. Mishra.
What do you mean "for now"?

154
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,419
It means ...

155
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,007
- If anything happens to the guy,

156
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,717
she will be continued

157
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,971
for incitement to suicide. It means a trial,

158
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,057
Court, media, journalists,
the whole thing!

159
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,686
No need to whine.
Go pay the bail over there

160
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,396
- We're from the same community

161
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,189
- Go pay the bail and get out!

162
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,405
- The centrifugal force is converted into centripetal force,

163
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,614
by rotation.

164
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,075
The body rises vertically.

165
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:35,996
This is where the civil engineer comes in.

166
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,247
Questions ?

167
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,582
- NO, PROFESSOR.

168
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,294
- Are your lessons over soon?

169
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,672
- I have two months left, Dad.

170
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,258
After the exams, then the recruitment.

171
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,719
- The ... what ? 
- To land a job.

172
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,139
Don't you need to pay lots of money to get a job?

173
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,016
- Not anymore, Mother

174
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,226
The Railway and Electric companies...

175
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,479
we have an interview. They hire on merit

176
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,992
Instead of supervising the ash cleaning,
you're eating here?

177
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,119
What if they stole the money again?

178
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,579
- Uncle Shambhu is there.

179
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,539
- Shambhu is depressed.

180
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,458
- I no longer have the right to eat?

181
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,179
- How much will you be paid?

182
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,766
- They tell you after the interview.

183
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,226
- In any case, that's a good thing.

184
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,564
The sooner you are gone, the better.

185
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,902
If you stay, you'll waste your life setting the corpse on fire.

186
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,700
- Good food.

187
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,877
- Look. I found some silvers.

188
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,921
- Show me ?

189
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,299
You really don't know anything about it. It's aluminum.

190
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:26,398
- Hello, prof. I had time to wash myself, while waiting for you.

191
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,116
You have not come for 3 days.

192
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,536
- Shut up and work.

193
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,266
- Is your father here?

194
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,936
- No, he's in the ghat. - Call him.

195
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:09,399
(* - following landslides caused by floods,)

196
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:14,487
(* many houses were destroyed in Sherpur and Semara.)

197
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,825
(* The inhabitants went in front of the building of the local authorities)

198
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,203
(* to require assistance and rehousing solutions.)

199
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,000
(* This sector has suffered from landslides for a long time.)

200
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,962
(* The land is regularly washed away by the waters of the Ganges.)

201
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,757
(* The demonstrators complain of leading a nomadic life.)

202
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,469
(* They claim to have received no help,)

203
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,388
(* despite the many steps taken.)

204
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,850
(* The villagers seized the Mandala commission to ...)

205
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:44,976
- He is dead.

206
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:49,397
(* -The organizer of the movement, Mr. Prem Nath Gupta,)

207
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,940
(* is ready to continue)

208
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,319
(* as long as the families have not been rehoused.)

209
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,623
- You offered tea

210
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,917
or something ?

211
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,127
- Sit down.

212
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,254
- Sorry. I took some time.

213
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,845
- The young man is dead, Mr. Pathak.

214
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,431
Apparently a piece of glass

215
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,353
entered the vein. I brought the court papers.

216
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,065
- You sign them. - No, wait ...

217
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,110
How does this affect us?

218
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,947
- It's a case of incitement to suicide.

219
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:49,123
- Wait, Inspector. 
Excuse me, you were there when he killed himself.

220
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,293
It was you who threatened him.

221
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,093
- So here, it's the world upside down.

222
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,387
Listen to me, Pathak.

223
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:07,725
Keep your little reasoning to rip off your ghetto pilgrims.

224
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,143
It's understood ?

225
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,063
Did you see the stories on the TV?

226
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,607
The high school porn texting affair,

227
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,235
that of Kashmir, and now,

228
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,945
it's your daughter.

229
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,950
- Tell us what we can do to get out of there?

230
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,875
- How much do you earn ?

231
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,716
- Within 8 to 10,000 rupees per month.

232
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,427
- Does she also have a salary?

233
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,972
- Yes. At a computer coaching institute

234
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,434
- Well. So it's very simple.

235
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,771
Incitement to suicide,

236
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,234
the press, the legal proceedings, I take care of it.

237
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,154
You have to find 300,000 rupees.

238
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,490
Within 3 months. I'll give you 3 months to find.

239
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,744
- Excuse me, you misunderstood.

240
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,330
We are a very modest family.

241
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,331
Comment...

242
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,459
I can't bring together more than 50,000 ...

243
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,171
- Never haggle with me again. Never again !

244
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,632
I did not come to negotiate.

245
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,552
Do you take me for a carpet merchant?

246
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,597
Pathak sanglote.

247
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,643
I am here to save your honor. Yours!

248
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,147
Hold.

249
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,400
You see it. I have the entire arrest on video.

250
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,944
Do you want me to put it on the Internet?

251
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:46,157
I'm gonna do a hell of a pub for you and your daughter in Benares.

252
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:48,576
I give you 48 hours

253
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,578
to find 100,000 rupees.

254
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,873
Stop nodding your head! 

255
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,168
What did I say ?

256
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:01,255
- 100,000 rupees in 48 hours.

257
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,924
- And in 2 months?

258
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,927
- 200 000.

259
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,054
- There. It's easy to understand.

260
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,993
- Where are you going, madame?

261
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,540
- I'm going down to the ghat. 
- It's forbidden for women.

262
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,500
- Mister.

263
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,670
You have to hit hard on the skull, 5 blows.

264
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,553
- Piyush !

265
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,934
- Deepak, help him a little.

266
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,355
- Piyush...

267
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:04,026
- Hit hard. It is like this that the soul is liberated.

268
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,959
- I collected 26 rupees. Look.

269
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,210
- Yes. Where?

270
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:25,131
- I dived and held my breath for a very long time.

271
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,132
- So what ?

272
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,259
- Let me play with the others.

273
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,555
- You want to go bet?

274
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,850
- It's not a bet, it's a sport. I am old.

275
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:36,851
- You speak...

276
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,312
Queue! Go get clients.

277
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,398
- You have a broom stuck somewhere.

278
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,444
- That's my pretty Pooja.

279
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,446
She's cute, isn't she?

280
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,658
- Can you ask her the name of her friend?

281
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,910
- And what do I say then?

282
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,746
"Miss Pooja, your friend who loves poetry,

283
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,333
"my friend really likes her and would like to talk to her.

284
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,752
"Give me her name, please."

285
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,796
No, I know. We're going to write to her.

286
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,131
- He's in love. Must be crazy.

287
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:10,301
- His bed is too big for him alone.

288
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,720
He's tired of playing 5 to 1.

289
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,890
- What is this noise? - Shhh!

290
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,809
Wait, I know.

291
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,353
Do you remember her face? Yes ?

292
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,564
Are you sure? Really sure?

293
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,609
We are going to watch

294
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,403
on their university's Facebook.

295
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,282
- You were on Pooja's album. There will be her photo, right?

296
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,077
- Yes, she must be on her friends list.

297
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:37,995
Do you see her ?

298
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,874
- It's her ! Look .

299
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,545
- "Shaalu Gupta."

300
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,797
She comes from a good family caste.

301
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:48,923
- You aim high.

302
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,095
- Open a Facebook account. Afterwards, it will go by itself.

303
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,390
Are you listening? Ask her if she wants to be your friend.

304
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,225
Should I do that to you?

305
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,143
Huh? - Yes.

306
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:04,605
- Lets' go ! Nothing to lose and everything to gain.

307
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,941
It's madness what's going on here.

308
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,361
In just 30 minutes, 10 rupees will become 50 rupees.

309
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,114
And 50 rupees brings in 200.

310
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,577
- Come on. You can start betting.

311
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,205
4 plongeurs: Lokwa, Munwa, Netwa, Baboua.

312
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,666
- 20 rupees on whom? - Lokwa.

313
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,002
- 10 on Lokwa. - Encore on Lokwa.

314
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,837
- 20 rupees on Netwa.

315
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,547
- Okay. 20 rupees.

316
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,049
- It will start.

317
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,259
Children ...

318
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,927
1...

319
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,345
2...

320
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:37,388
[Whistle]

321
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,312
Let's go ! The competition has started.

322
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,272
Which one will reassemble the 1st parts?

323
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,109
We wait for the moment of truth. Lokwa is the first to go up.

324
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,485
- Hurry, Netwa.

325
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,613
- Baboua, also with 3 pieces.

326
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,781
Who's going to come back up now?

327
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,117
Munwa also brings back 3 coins.

328
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,619
Look...

329
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:04,290
- I want to dive too. 
- No way. No, I'm telling you.

330
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,708
- 6 more pieces!

331
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,251
Those who bet

332
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,297
on Netwa will win 3 times the amount they wagered.

333
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,133
- Sikandar !

334
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,886
This foot protrudes. Put it back on the fire.

335
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,391
- Hi, Sikandar !

336
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,685
The old man got drunk.

337
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,605
- I'd have a drink,

338
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,316
king of the ghats, just a little last.

339
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,822
- Do I look like a king?

340
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,117
- As they say, there are only two kings in Benares.

341
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:44,163
The Maharajah and the King of the Ghats.

342
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,581
The first, above,

343
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,959
and you guys at the bottom.

344
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,502
- He looks like a king,

345
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,753
Shambhu Chacha ?

346
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,967
How many days of work do you have per year?

347
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,677
Shambhu Chacha !

348
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:01,305
- What do you think, boss? Only one day every 10 years.

349
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,140
One day. 
- His turns...

350
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,268
only once every 10 years. You heard ?

351
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,812
You understand ?

352
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,107
This means that on that day,

353
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:15,361
all the money there is to be made in the ghat is for him.

354
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,409
When you think that Shambhu's father,

355
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:24,036
his turn came back once a year ...

356
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,415
And imagine that this idiot had 10 children.

357
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,250
We divide by 10.

358
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,964
Her father could earn a living once a year.

359
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,342
Shambhu can earn it once every 10 years.

360
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,761
Oh yes, poor man.

361
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,556
His turn only returns every 10 years.

362
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,227
When is the next time you work?

363
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,270
- I finished.

364
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,981
No next time. I sold my cremating spot

365
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,483
Lala Chaudury.

366
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,861
He gave me 100,000 rupees.

367
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,281
I will be a beggar until I die.

368
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:04,577
- If I sold you my cremating spot, Lala, would you give me a million?

369
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,829
- I would be surprised if you sold it. 

370
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:08,539
- Son, can I sell it to him?

371
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,332
- Why are you asking him?

372
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,335
He doesn't give a shit, of the ghat,

373
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,087
since he studied.

374
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,674
- Are you criticizing my son? I won't sell you my cremating spot.

375
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,510
- But you never meant to.

376
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:23,596
- Papa,

377
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:27,058
do you have some money? I'm going to Durga Puja's party.

378
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,226
- Yes. Look in my tunic.

379
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,479
- Can I take 300 rupees?

380
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,397
- Take what you want.

381
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,983
All I have is for you.

382
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,347
- Are you going to tell me?

383
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,102
- What do you want to know ?

384
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,395
- I want to know what happened.

385
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,525
Who was it? Why did you do that?

386
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,987
- He was coming to take computer lessons.

387
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:26,408
I typed for his 2nd year thesis..., and voila.

388
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,577
We became friends. That's all.

389
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,875
- And that's all ?

390
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,837
- Yes.

391
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,589
We got along well. I liked talking to him.

392
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:47,513
- You did this without thinking, without asking yourself a single question,

393
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,808
neither why nor how, without thinking of the consequences.

394
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,894
Come on, answer!

395
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,568
So ?

396
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,243
Are you listening to me? 
- I don't know!

397
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,292
- A young man died.

398
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,086
Your father has a debt of 300,000 rupees.

399
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,297
I had to empty my savings account.

400
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,049
You risk ending up in prison,

401
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,677
and you answer me: "I don't know."

402

[Friend request sent]

403
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,480
Are you coming to the Durga Puja party?

404
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:14,975
- 20 rupees.

405
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,029
* -Put your watch here.

406
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:28,530
*Slowly !

407
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,158
* The watch is at the bottom.

408
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,701
* Blow hard on it.

409
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,455
* I am looking for the watch.

410
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:37,957
* She is no longer there.

411
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,501
*Rest assured.

412
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:41,627
*Your watch

413
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:45,881
* is in the pocket of one of the spectators: this one.

414
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,342
* The red checkered shirt.

415
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,010
* Look in your pockets.

416
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:53,097
* And voila, we found the watch. Come closer.

417
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,766
* Come join me on stage.

418
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,268
*What is your name ?

419
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,477
*-Deepak.

420
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,229
*-"Deepak."

421
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,404
- Swallow the smoke.

422
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,323
He can't smoke.

423
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,491
Come on, try.

424
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,869
- Why are you throwing it away?

425
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,665
I will never smoke again. Yesterday, my friends forced me.

426
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,019
- What are you watching ? - She released her balloon.

427

[Shaalu accepted your request to add.]

428
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,967
- I used to earn 12,000 rupees. It's the minimum.

429
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,637
- Shut up. He is the son of Tripathi.

430
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:57,638
- Your father

431
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,600
taught me Sanskrit. All that I am I have to

432
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,352
To his knowledge.

433
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,062
Bring him some tea.

434
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,980
- No, we're in a hurry.

435
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,650
I have a book translation to finish.

436
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:12,194
- A glass of water ? Bring water.

437
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,198
I read it, you sent it to me.

438
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,117
To tell the truth,

439
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,577
we don't have a trainer position.

440
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,497
We are missing someone at the reception,

441
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,333
to welcome new students.

442
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,711
You also need to do some data entry.

443
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,839
We can go out of 5,500.

444
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,674
- Okay. It's perfect.

445
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,636
She can start tomorrow. Thanks a lot, Sanjay.

446

- You're welcome. It is my duty.

I have a call.

448
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,143
Have a drink. We have a new bottle.

449
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,813
The water tastes very good and it is very fresh.

450
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,315
If you allow ... Hello ?

451
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,860
Yes, Mr. Shoukla. Hello.

452
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,028
- Only 5,500?

453
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,490
- Did you hear how respectful he was?

454
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:03,454
- Thank you.

455
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,006
Are you a student in engineering school?

456
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,092
- Yes. Civil engineering, in the final year.

457
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,306
We had a strike last year

458
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,475
otherwise I would already have a diploma,

459
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,143
and I would have a job.

460
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:30,481
What are your favorite hobbies? - The music.

461
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,107
- You sing ? - No.

462
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:37,446
I listen to a lot of music on the radio, and I have lots of CDs.

463
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,198
- And apart from the music?

464
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,241
- I really like poetry!

465
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,826
- Poetry? - Yes.

You know him ?

469
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,419
- Yes finally...

00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:57,841
Thank you.

471
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,010
Please.

472
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,846
Can we have some sauce? Chilli sauce?

473
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,932
You have some ? We would like some.

474
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,351
- Serve yourself. - You want some ?

475
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,560
- You first.

476
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,816
So...

477
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,944
Is it decided? We are friends ?

478
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:21,490
- Yes.

479
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,457
I want to tell you something important.

480
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,168
If ever, one day, you have a problem,

481
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,462
it will absolutely be necessary to speak to me about it.

482
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,839
- And what will you do?

483
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,261
- Well, I'll come and fix it.

484
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:46,515
If a boy annoys you, harasses you, makes you cry ...

485
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,017
It's dangerous here. There are thugs.

486
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,852
- Yes. Okay.

487
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,482
And if ever ... - Hot sauces.

488
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,986
If you make me cry?

489
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,362
- Me ?

490
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:01,863
How I... ?

491
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,912
Say it, I'll fix it.

492
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,751
- The name of the student at the top, in capital letters.

493
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,087
Here is the establishment's brochure

494
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,007
and a free CD with all the information.

495
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,260
Read this and come back tomorrow. We will register your son.

496
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,761
- Thank you. - Thank you.

497
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,356
- You explain it to them.

498
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,610
Is this your ever first job?

499
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,029
- Nope.

500
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,866
- What happened before?

501
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,285
- I didn't like work.

502
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,331
- You were in private Yadav class.

503
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,841
* -Participate in the game "Who is this face?"

504
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,428
* If you know who this actress is, answer today.

505
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:10,307
* If you give the correct answer, you can win a car.

506
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,059
* Our lines are open.

508
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,702
(Piyush Agarwal Death Announcement - September 17, 2014)

509
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:24,381
- Lets' go. Nothing to lose, everything to gain.

510
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,508
- Do you want to dive? - Yes.

511
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,968
- Slowly. - Come on!

512
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:32,139
- How much did you collect this morning? 
- More than all these guys.

513
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,766
- But be careful. - Okay.

514
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,476
- So let's go.

515
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,477
Come on, go!

516
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,521
Whistle

517
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,486
- We have a new participant. Jhonta!

518
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,448
How many coins will he bring back?

519
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,496
Well done, Jhonta!

520
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,207
Jhonta goes up like a rocket.

521
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,375
- Place the pieces.

522
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,461
- Will he beat the champion?

523
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:03,670
- Yes, dive in!

524
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:08,633
- It's good.

525
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:09,718
Hurry up.

526
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,011
- 20 rupees?

527
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:13,680
- Do not miss the opportunity to bet.

528
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,557
We can win big.

529
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:17,642
Jhonta brings back other coins!

530
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,731
- Piyush Agarwal,

531
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,524
Hometown: Allahabad?

532
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,281
He is deceased.

533
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,241
Accidentally.

534
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,077
- I read the announcement.

535
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:41,541
I come from the school where he took evening classes.

536
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,377
He left a file that belonged to him.

537
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,838
There is an overpayment to repay.

538
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,424
He had also forgotten a few books.

539
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,470
Can I get his address?

540
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,848
- We're going back up. It's over. Get out.

541
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,809
Who has the most coins?

542
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:00,143
So, Munna?

543
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,062
Who is the winner?

544
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,606
- It's Jhonta! - Jhonta!

545
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:05,774
- One l .

546
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:09,694
- I told you I'd win. - You are the best.

547
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,196
I'm proud of you.

548
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,366
Piyush's father: Ramdhari Agarwal

549
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:24,876
*-Hallo?

550
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,968
* -I tell you:

551
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,263
* "Keep the stars captive to your eyes

552
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,099
* "The night is dark and long and the morning, far away

553
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,643
"Travelers, vagabonds

554
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,478
"We both are

555
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,357
* "We will meet again at the crossroads"

556
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:49,651
- It's finish ?

557
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,280
- What? Yes, it's over. I have finished.

558
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,281
*-Pardon.

559
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,826
The little that I understood, I found it great!

560
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,412
- What, you can be stupid!

561
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,790
And adorable.

562
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,709
- What? What?

563
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,419
*-I said nothing.

564
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,129
- I heard.

565
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,756
- If I read Chakbast, you will faint.

566
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,013
- I saw that it was soon your birthday.

567
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,474
- Yes, but you don't know what I'm going to do.

568
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:22,851
- What?

569
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:24,811
- A picnic.

570
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,313
- Shaalu? *-Ah yes ?

571
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,314
- Shaalu?

572
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,482
- My mother is calling me. See you later.

573
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:30,942
- Wait!

574
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,027
* Don't hang up.

575
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,069
- What?

576
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,615
- Please call me by my name

577
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:37,699
* Talk to me.

578
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,453
- Learn 2 lines, and recite them to me.

579
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,080
* (Afterwards, we'll see. I'll hang up.)

580
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,081
- Hallo ?

581
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,833
- Goodbye.

582
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,835
He's laughing.

583
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,675
* This one is from Dushyant Kumar.

584
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,053
* "You are the passing train

585
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,138
* "I am the quivering bridge

586
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,224
* "Your eyes are a jungle

587
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,393
* "Where I lose my steps"

588
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,063
* -But finally, who is on the device?

589
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,440
- May I speak to Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal?

590
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,526
*-It's me. I listen. What do you want ?

591
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,529
- Uh ... I ...

592
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,659
* -But talk, finally. Gone?

593
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,036
This is the Kashi Cooperative Bank

594
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,705
about our new savings plan.

595
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,917
*-No thanks. I am not interested. Goodbye.

596
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,153
- I'm asking you the question frankly.

597
00:44:58,905 --> 00:44:59,864
Will you sleep with me?

598
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,494
No one will know.

599
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,413
You had sex with him too, right?

600
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,960
- It's good quality.

601
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,296
- It's too expensive. - Let me give you a discount

602
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,216
320 rupees for the two mats. And I add ...

603
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,470
Think it over and come back later, okay?

604
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:23,805
Okay ?

605
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,602
- I quit my job.

606
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:36,026
- Your daughter hadn't come for a long time.

607
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,235
- Hello.

608
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,408
- Go away. Don't stay there.

609
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,827
- What?

610
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,080
- Should I drown myself with shame?

611
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,081
Go away!

612
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,298
Indian Railways - Recruitment Madam admitted.

613
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,842
What went through your mind?

614
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,260
- Nothing.

615
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:05,638
- "Nothing", "I don't know", that's all you say.

616
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,182
Am I a bad father?

617
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:11,770
I left you free to study like a boy.

618
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,355
I deserved that you caused this scandal?

619
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,857
- It's not a scandal.

620
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,026
- Then what is this, then?

621
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,237
Why am I dying to pay?

622
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,406
On the ghat, in the streets,

623
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:27,285
I'm always afraid people will talk to me about you. 
It is a scandal.

624
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:30,330
- That's your fear, not my fear

625
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,290
Hence, I've decided not to live here anymore

626
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,960
The smaller the city, the narrower the world-view

627
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:39,214
- You live under my roof and my world-view is narrow?

628
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,925
- Is that where you wanted to come from?

629
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:43,426
You want me to pay you

630
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:44,761
a rent ?

631
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:47,597
- Look at me.

632
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,933
What are you looking for ?

633
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,602
Are you looking for revenge on me? About what ?

634
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:53,937
- Mom !

635
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:58,108
- "Mummy mummy"...

636
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:03,488
You don't even remember her. You were 6 years old!

637
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,740
- A 6-year-old is blind?

638
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,786
- I took her to the hospital, didn't I?

639
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,248
- For 2 days, she begged to go to the hospital.

640
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,792
"I have partials to correct."

641
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,627
You didn't try to help her.

642
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:21,005
- We thought we had a fever. And that's in the past.

643
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,882
Do not complain.

644
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,552
I quit teaching for my daughter!

645
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,305
I find myself in the ghats for my daughter!

646
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,640
Did I kill your mother?

647
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,601
- And I killed this boy at the hotel?

648
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,188
Did I kill him?

649
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,275
He killed himself! Alone.

650
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,116
- You're crazy. You mix things up that have nothing to do with it.

651
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,829
- I'm not mixing anything up.

652
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,250
Drop it. Don't worry.

653
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,878
I won't go to jail.

654
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,921
- Make it up to you.

655
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,008
Me, I'm looking for money, like a poor idiot.

656
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:07,260
- I'll manage to pay the policeman.

666
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,254
- Are you recording her voice on the phone?

667
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:47,217
- Yes, and I put songs that go well with it.

668
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,470
- A real genius. Thanks to my dating lessons.

669
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,139
- Nice birthday present.

670
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,684
- She's of high caste.

671
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,062
Don't get too carried away.

672
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:00,897
Did you tell her, your caste?

673
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,987
Start by telling her, and you'll see.

674
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,864
Not everyone has broad ideas.

675
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:13,201
- I know. I have the time. I'll tell him later.

676
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,497
- We're not there.

677
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,874
When he gets a job,
none of this will matter

678
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,627
- Give him the keys to your motorcycle. - Why ?

679
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,545
- He's going to surprise her.

680
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,173
Give the keys!
He'll pay you for the fuel

681
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,217
- First word.

682
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,135
A plant ?

683
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:33,429
- A lamp ?

684
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,556
- An oil lamp. - A candle.

685
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,683
- A Bush ?

686
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,394
I dunno. A tree ?

687
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,027
I don't know.

688
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,071
- A motorcycle ! - No, a flower.

689
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:52,198
- Look!

690
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,852
- Where are you going?

691
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,270
- Where you want.

692
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,397
Get on

693
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,317
- Your bag.

694
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,362
Shall I sit?? - Yes go ahead.

695
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:37,243
Do you know what we call your bus?

696
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,411
- No. Tell me.

697
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:40,246
- Chick-Wagon!

698
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:50,006
You never told me.

699
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,257
Where do you live?

700
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,097
- Uh ... Bhelupur, you know?

701
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:01,142
- Bhelupur? - Yes. At home, it's after.

702
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:04,103
- My friend Prerna lives in this neighborhood.

703
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,939
I will text her then come to see you.

704
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,608
Isn't that great?

705
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:13,112
- You will come to my place ?

706
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,158
If your parents find out, how will they react?

707
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:19,577
- If you do not want...

708
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,956
- Of course it is. I didn't mean to say that, excuse me.

709

Hold it for a second.

717

719
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,738
Have you been to the Sangam?

720
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,867
I've been there plenty of times.

721
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,669
In few days we'll be off on
a pilgrimage in a bus

722
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:55,047
We all go: uncles, aunts, grandparents ...

723

Will you come along?

724
00:52:58,384 --> 00:52:59,760
- Where? - On the pilgrimage.

725
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,721
- With your family ? - Yes.

726
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:07,727
- I have to think about it. We'll discuss it again later.

727
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:28,539
- What?

728
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:32,001
You must be the youngest
in your family, right?

729
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,253
- Yes.

730
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,755
How did you know?

731
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,884

732
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:45,389
That hurts!
Your hand is like a hammer!

733
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,558
- It's because of my ring.

734
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:49,602
My uncle

735
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,104
Gave it to me when I was little.

736
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,898
I can't take it off anymore.

737
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:56,943
My finger has grown, but the ring has not.

738
00:53:57,652 --> 00:54:01,531
As I am the youngest, I have always been cuddled.

739
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:05,952
What?

740
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,412
- I dunno.

741
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:26,681
Suddenly, I too wanted to cuddle you.

742
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,796
Shaalu. - Yes ?

743
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,009
- Will you marry me ?

744
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:50,056
- I dunno.

745
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,478
- Would your parents agree?

746
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:57,605
- I dunno.

747
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,358
Do you want to come and see them?

748
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,318
- Would you like to introduce me?

749
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:07,239
- You don't give me your address, and you want to know my parents?

750
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:31,430
I go.

751
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,349
- Is your house not far?

752
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,770
- Just there. First on the right, first on the left.

753
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,066
And where is your place?

754
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,819
After Bhelupur, you said. This is ...

755
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,487
Shivala?

756
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:48,114
Or then ...

757
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,949
Kamacha!

758
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,575
No, I know.

759
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,870
- Durgakund. - Why ?

760
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,038
Did what?

761
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:02,002
I told you I stay near Bhelupur.
You have nothing else to talk about?

762
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,629
- I was joking...

763
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,589
- Do you find it amusing?

764
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,216
You want to know ?

765
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:09,677
Okay. Come on, I'll show you.

766
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:15,558
Hop on. I will show you, since you are so impatient.

767
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:17,518
Do you want the truth?

768
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:21,355
I live in Harishchandra ghat . I was born there.

769
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,816

The work of me, my father, my brother, my uncle. For ages

771
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:30,531
Have you ever seen a body burning?

772
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:33,075
Answer me: have you ever seen any?

773
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:37,580
I see them all day. From morning to night, I burn bodies.

774
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:41,417
In the fire, the skin comes off. Only the skull remains.

775
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:46,464
We smash the skull with a stick. The ashes are purified in the Ganges.

776
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,341
Can you watch that? Do you want to come and see?

777
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:53,345
What happened? Will you send text to your friend now?

778

779

01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,417
Except the salad.

823
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,336
Even the lentils were brilliant

824
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:17,591
It doesn't surprise me that it's good, 
it's run by people of same caste as us. The Ghupta.

825
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,286
So, you finally called, huh?

826
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:49,415
- It was you who made a scene, and you are angry with me?

827
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,792
- Sorry.

828
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,211
- I'm not waiting for an apology.

829
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,131
- I'm a fool! 
*-That is true.

830
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,508
- I don't know how to express myself.

831
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:00,968
- That is also true.

832
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,304
- Are you coming soon?

833
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:08,517
* -We still have 5 or 6 hours on the road. We are in Saharanpur.

834
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:09,893
Ok, listen...

835
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:13,147
My parents, as I know them ...

836
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:15,858
They won't accept you.

837
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:21,739
* They have a very traditional mentality.

838
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,325
But I am on your side.

839
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,454
With time, parents do come around

840
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,082
Just get yourself a good job

841
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,421
- Yes. I started sending CVs.

842
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:41,300
I'll give my all to find

843
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,593
* a good job.

844
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,721
- Yes. Courage. For the rest, we'll see.

845
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,393
And if I have to run away, I'll run with you.

846
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:53,979
*Take care of yourself.

847
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,120
Hey man! Let's go back!

848
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,413
- We just left.

849
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,916
I have plenty of classes to review.

850
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,168
We turn around!

851
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:20,214
Sir, another sheet.

852
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,677
I am in the last year of civil engineering.

853
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,847
from Seth Kinaram Agarwal
Polytechnique College

854
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:32,935
My career objective is to
pursue a career in engineering...

855
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,646
with focus on mechanical drafting

856
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,566
I have a job soon. Come back soon.

857
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,248
- We were brought bodies.

858
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,250
Shove the skull inside

859
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,960
- We need help.

860
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,420
I will be back. I'll go get Deepak.

861
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:03,882
- Deepak !

862
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,551
- What? - Get up!

863
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:08,512
Dad's drunk again and there
are lots of bodies to burn

864
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,764
Get up, I tell you!

865
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,728
They only think of sleeping here.

866
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,064
I can't take any more of this doggy job.

867
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,566
Come on, Deepak!

868
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,040
- Dirty thief!

869
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:38,834
Catch them!

870
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:42,296
Give him a beating, that little jerk. Dirty thief.

871
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,339
Get out ! - We are leaving.

872
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,843
- Watch out, or I'll throw you into the fire! - Don't stay here.

873
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:51,889
- It's a plague, these thieves. 
We have already had enough trouble like that.

874
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,100
- Don't stay in the middle.

875
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,226
- Hey, go ahead!

876
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,562
- You didn't cover the body.

877
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,316
- Shambhu Chacha! We must add a beaker here.

878
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,109
- Yes I am going.

879
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:05,527
- Prepare a beaker.

880
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:07,779
- Where is your father? He is drunk.

881
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,281
- Deepak! Come see.

882
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:14,745
Finish this one and prepare a beaker by the water.

883
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:15,746
- Over there?

884
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,207
- Yes, very close to the shore.

885
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,042
- Shall I finish this one? - Yes.

886
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:22,878
- Sanjay! We're not going to get there, alone.

887
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,547
- I can't do it either.

888
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:28,300
But I'm not asking anyone for anything. - Warning !

889
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:31,178
I told you to be careful. Ah, there you are.

890
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,971
- Bring me some sawdust!

891
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:40,812
- It's always the same.

892
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,527
Take them all.

893
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:52,658
- Manohar, go get another one. What are you doing ?

894
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,456
- We will see tomorrow. I am tired.

895
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:05,796
- Hey, Deepak! Give us a hand.

896
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,437
Careful.

897
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,316
- Slowly.

898
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,905
- Where do all these deaths come from?

899
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:36,535
- A pilgrim bus had an accident. It fell into the Ganges.

900
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:37,536
Really?

901
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:41,039
Public aid workers dumped
all the bodies here

902
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,125
- Isn't there a single survivor?

903
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:44,334
- Nope.

904
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:54,131
- On all the trains that pass here,

905
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,592
there are 28 that stop at our station.

906
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,052
How many do not stop,

907
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:00,137
In your opinion?

908
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:03,473
- Exactly 64.

909
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,768
Which means, it's
easy to come here...

910
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:08,270
but it's more difficult to leave!

911
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:16,194
- It's not true. - You drank too much.

912
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,613
- But it was way too strong.

913
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,866
- Whiskey. - I don't have the alcohol?

914
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:21,908
- Following.

915
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,326
- I didn't say that.

916
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,912
- We have tickets on the waiting list.

917
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:27,831
Can you check?

918
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:29,082
It was nice,

919
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,500
but we have to go home.

920
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:31,877
- One more day.

921
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,420
- No seats.

922
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,089
- What about last minute cancellations?

923
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,841
Even one seat for both of us is fine

924
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:40,135
- Naughty.

925
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:43,889
- Stop it, idiot. 
- Come on, we'll stay until tomorrow.

926
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,016
(26 places available)

927
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,604
- I'm not going back to that rotten hotel.

928
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,314
- No, I have nothing.

929
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,316
- No cancellations? - No.

930
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,819
- Shit ! What are we going to do ?

931
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:48,453
*-Hello?

932
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,457
* -I am the father of Piyush. I know who you are.

933
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:54,501
* Were you at the hotel with him?

934
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:56,920
*-What are you doing ? Let me talk to her.

935
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,631
* -It's me speaking. Go back to the kitchen!

936
01:10:59,798 --> 01:11:02,384
* Did you kill Piyush? Answer!

937
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:12,185
- Get closer ! - You bet 30 rupees on Baboua.

938
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,479
- 20 on Munwa. - A real spectacle.

939
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:15,939
- Jhonta!

940
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,899
- Now these 4 boys

941
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,442
are going to dive ...

942
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:20,860
- Jhonta!

943
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:24,364
- Stop screaming. Bet on another boy.

944
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:27,242
Bet on Baboua, he is very fast.

945
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:28,952
- Baboua, okay.

946
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,662
- How ? - 200 rupees.

947
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:33,164
- The professor bets 200 on Baboua!

948
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:34,666
Prepare to dive.

949
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,585
Attention. 1, 2...

950
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,091
- I have something

951
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,551
in the mouth ? - NO !

952
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,387
- I'll swallow that bullet. Look carefully.

953
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,274
Warning. 1 ... 2 ... and ...

954
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,197
- 140, 150 ... Here

955
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,616
I deserve at least 500 Rupees

956
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,159
- We'll adjust it next time

957
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,119
300...

958
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,997
How much have you lost, professor?

959
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:32,223
Look how late it is!

960
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:35,644
Heh ?

961
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:40,315
Responds.

962
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:42,400
Little snot!

963
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:44,235
Your responses?

964
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:45,236
Heh ?

965
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,321
Do you hear me?

966
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,614
- I was having fun !

967
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:52,160
- You're here to work, you little shit, not to have fun.

968
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,663
- It's my money. Mind your ass.

969
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,248
- Shut up. You sound like thugs

970
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,918
Those other orphan kids
have ruined you

971
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,214
I want you to be here

972
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:05,715
when there is dive competition.

973
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,886
He takes himself for the King of Benares. He wastes money!

974
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,388
- I'll tell Devi everything!

975
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,516
- I do not care. Tell her what you want.

976
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:16,309
Start by sitting down!

977
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:18,853
I don't want to see you move.

978
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,313
Sit down, I tell you.

979
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,190
Mule head.

980
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:25,694
From now on,
I want all your winnings

981
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:33,910
- Hi, Deepak.

982
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,120
Come on ...

983
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,958
Stop crying. Try to sleep.

984
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:43,795
- This test will count towards your recruitment.

985
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,172
Here is the theme of the debate:

- How can you say that?

990
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:57,851
- The effluents are released into the water.

991
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,645
- If we see it that way, we can't help it.

992
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:04,357
- Do you think it's better to close your eyes?

993
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,236
- It's easy to accuse others.

What do you propose ?

How are you going to reduce poverty?

Speak, say something.

998

You've been silent too long. Say something.

999

No, it's okay.

We are here.

Mr. Pathak?

What is happening ?

1017
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:44,601
- Give me three days.

1018
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:45,977
- I've done it before.

1019
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,063
- My daughter is not well. She was ill.

1020

Mr. Verma ...

1021
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,820
an advance would be possible?

Hold.

1026
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,666
You're welcome.

1027

Come on.

- How many ?

1030
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,571
- Only 30,000, so far.

1031

1038
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:09,644
I'll be able to find the money.

1039
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,813
- Are you kidding me ?

1040
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,318
I want the full amount or nothing.

1041
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,071
Are you a kid?

1042
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:23,282
- I'll bring you the rest this week.

1043
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,493
Take that in the meantime.

1044
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:28,913
I beg you.

1045
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,378
- It will be fine this time.

1046
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:38,172
But next month I want the whole thing.

1047
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:22,592
Lala bought your cremating spot? 
- I will never sell him!

1048
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:25,511
- Sikandar sold to him for 300,000 rupees.

1049
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,389
- How could he sell it to him? - it will go.

1050
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:29,515
- He's not at Kallou's.

1051
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:31,934
- Where is that bastard?

1052
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,269
[Luxa police station]

1053
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:18,189
- What can the police tell us?

1054
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:19,398
Ah, Deepak.

1055
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,484
You haven't found Sikandar?

1056
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:24,695
- I knew it was rubbish.

1057
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,365
- Come. - Dirty thief.

1058
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:30,243
We are going to clarify everything. Come.

1059
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,829
- See you later. - What a story.

1060
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,707
- The law authorizes him to sell your cremating spot.

1061
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,501
- Show me the law!

1062
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:41,170
- Why talk about the law?

1063
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,507
You had been advised against it. Arrange it between you.

1064
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:47,343
- Between us, he may not live long.

1065
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,221
- Give me the money back, and take back your cremating spot.

1066
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,682
- You won't have a rupee! - Calm down.

1067
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:56,144
- There is no evidence that he paid Sikandar.

1068
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,563
- Go get him, your Sikandar.

1069
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:01,566
Ask him if I haven't given him 300,000.

1070
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:05,778
- Where am I going to find 300,000?

1071
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,071
- I do not care.

1072
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:11,242
Mr. Dubey, I make this commitment in front of you.

1073
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:14,620
If he repays the 300,000, he may have his cremating spot back.

1074
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:19,458
I will not forget how I was received here today.

1075
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:20,835
Looking forward to it.

1076
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:38,519
- No one will offer you better in all of Benares.

1077
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:53,993
- 70 rupees.

1078
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,916
- Sir, I'm in a hurry.

1079
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,793
- Arrival station? - Calcutta.

1080
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,794
- That's good,

1081
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:06,756
your goddess name. Looks like you have 8 arms.

1082
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,925
You sell 4 tickets per minute.

1083
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:10,426
I had never seen that.

1084
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,055
- Sir, I'm in a hurry. - Yes.

1085
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:16,057
Where are you going? - Mirzapour.

1086
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,812
My father said: "The one who has never eaten

1088
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,072
Taste, please.

1089
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,531
- It's for you.

1090
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,784
- I know you'll leave some.

1091
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:38,120
It was my father who prepared it. It is his birthday.

1092
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,207
- Well.

1093
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,174
- It's good, isn't it?

1094
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:51,425
- Delicious

1095
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,809
- You live alone ?

1096
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:00,810
- Nope.

1097
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,687
I live with my father.

1098
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,772
It is my father who lives alone.

1099
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,485
I mean, he's alone during the day.

1100
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:11,612
- Ah yes.

1101
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:17,743
- Rice pudding?

1102
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:22,540
- I haven't done it for a long time.

1103
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:27,670
- I'll eat it tomorrow morning. I'm not hungry anymore.

1104
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:32,508
- Yes, eat.

1105
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:36,554
I know you love it.

1106
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:45,104
- It's very good.

1107
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,316
Is there any milk left for tomorrow morning?

1108
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,736
What's the matter ?

1109
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:54,155
- I finished my first month of work.

1110
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:55,781
I got my salary.

1111
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,576
- How much?

1112
01:23:58,743 --> 01:23:59,869
- 20 000.

1113
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,663
- Well I ...

1114
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,417
Come on, sit down.

1115
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:13,758
You didn't tell me you had this job.

1116
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:16,635
It's temporary

1117
01:24:17,345 --> 01:24:20,973
I will work on it while I collect the money we owe.

1118
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,017
Then..
-And then?

1119
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:33,778
- I want to go to Allahabad University for training.

1120
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,740
I will work part time in IT.

1121
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:40,493
- Do you want to leave the house?

1122
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:43,954
- Heh?

1123
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,086
- Yes.

1124
01:24:51,796 --> 01:24:53,130
- Why ?

1125
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,385
- If it wasn't for this case,
I would have already left ...

1126
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:04,308
Maybe I'm better off alone

1127
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,269
Anyway, it's not far.

1128
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,063
I'll be back. 
- And your father?

1129
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:19,532
I don't even exist for you?

1130
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,664
You've thought of everything except me.

1131
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,798
It wasn't my fault. I didn't kill your mother.

1132
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:44,014
I'm going to go to bed in a ghet and I'm going to die.

1133
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:47,935
- Papa, please

1134
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:54,775
Don't cry, please.

1135
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:49,491
- Do I have to specify it? - No. Tell the interview.

1136
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,295
- The narrow lanes will disappear. We do not use them

1137
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:05,758
more than in the mountains. Normal channels will prevail.

1138
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,843
- Are you available immediately?

1139
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:08,969
- Yes sir.

1140
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,014
- You are offered a 6-month mission to Allahabad.

1141
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:16,101
- Thank you. - Excellent profile. Congratulations.

1142
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:33,744
- It will be necessary to secure the access.

1143

* -Today for the great feast of Shiva,

1144
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,553
* great diving competition! All together...

1145
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,223
- OM NAMA SHIVAYA!

1146
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:56,475
- You are in shape ?

My little Jhonta!

1175
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,380
I'll never make you dive again, my boy.

Do I have something in this hand?

1181
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:10,442
Do I have something in this hand?

1182
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:11,985

1189
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,968
- The Ganges gave it to me earlier.

1190
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,780
- Okay. This is very good.

1191
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:00,576
- Hold. - Good.

1192
01:33:01,201 --> 01:33:03,412
Thank you.

1193
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:42,367
- Quick, it's hot.

1194
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:45,621
I put you some pancakes for the train.

1195
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:48,248
Eat. I'll finish your bag.

1196
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,925

1197
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:10,854
Let's go ?

1198
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:24,993

1199
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:28,080
- Come on, I'm going. - Yes, get in.

1200
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:31,750
I'll pass the luggage to you.

1201
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:33,377
Sorry, big boy.

1202
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:37,339
Well. Come on, go sit down.

1203
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:39,216
- Take care of yourself, dad.

1204
01:34:39,383 --> 01:34:41,843
- Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

1205
01:35:35,022 --> 01:35:37,566
- Hello Madam. - Hello.

1206
01:35:37,733 --> 01:35:40,610
- I come to see Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal.

1207
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:42,404
My name is Devi Pathak.

1208
01:35:42,571 --> 01:35:46,199
Piyush and I were friends. I was with him the day ...

1209
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:49,870
- Okay. Come in, we'll talk inside.

1210
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:57,377
It's Devi Pathak.

1211
01:35:57,544 --> 01:36:00,088
She was the one with Piyush when ...

1212
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:03,050
[Slap]

1213
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:06,011
- What's the matter with you ? - How dare she?

1214
01:36:06,178 --> 01:36:08,221
- Are you okay, my daughter? Sit down.

1215
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:11,141
- Why him ? He hadn't done anything to you!

1216
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:03,128
Water?

1217
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:47,172
- You want to go to the Sangam?

1218
01:38:47,339 --> 01:38:49,424
For 30 rupees, I'll take you there.

1219
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:51,843
Are you interested, madam?

1220
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,929
And you, sir, are you coming?

1221
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:57,807
I take you to the Sangam. 30 rupees is cheap.

1222
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:01,561
30 rupees. Wait, I'm coming.

1223
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:05,482
- Thank you.

1224
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:15,450
- Hop on.

1225
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:18,453
Give me your hand, lady.

1226
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:21,289
Put yourself in the front.

1227
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:23,500
Go up, sir.

1228
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,987
- Is this the first time you're going?

1229
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,238
- Yes.

1230
01:39:54,531 --> 01:39:55,740
And you ?

1231
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:58,368
- This is the second time.

1232
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:04,082
They say you have to go twice.

1233
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:05,875
- Why?

1234
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:08,837
- Alone the first time, and with
someone the second time around.
