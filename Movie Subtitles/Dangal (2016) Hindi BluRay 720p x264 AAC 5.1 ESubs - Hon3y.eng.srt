1
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,876
<i>Has it come on?</i>

2
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,126
<i>No.</i>

3
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,043
<i>Now?</i>

4
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,460
<i>No.</i>

5
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,960
<i>Now?</i>

6
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,210
<i>No.</i>

7
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,876
Now?

8
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,043
<i>Turn the damn thing properly!</i>

9
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:14,918
<i>Welcome to the wrestling area
at the Seoul Olympics.</i>

10
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,918
<i>Looking forward to
an exciting match today.</i>

11
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,001
It's come on.

12
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,460
Shall I come down?

13
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:20,668
No.

14
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,376
Stand there holding it.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,168
<i>The final match this Olympics...
in the 72-kilo category,</i>

16
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:32,960
<i>between wrestlers from
Russia and America.</i>

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,376
<i>It's really sad that,</i>

18
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,585
<i>despite wrestling being
such a popular sport in India</i>

19
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:43,001
<i>Indian wrestlers have
disappointed in the Olympics.</i>

20
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,960
Even our boys
can bring home medals.

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,501
But where is the support?

22
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,376
Neither money,
nor facilities.

23
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:55,960
How will our boys win a medal?

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,710
If a medal could be won with words,

25
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,251
you would have won
it a long time ago.

26
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:08,793
Are you new here?

27
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,918
That's what I thought.

28
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:18,001
Try stepping into a
wrestling arena someday,

29
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:21,085
you'll run for your life
before the match begins.

30
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,335
Looks like you have
done it many times.

31
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,585
Run for your life.

32
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,043
If this were an arena,
then we'd see who would run.

33
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,626
Why do we need an arena?

34
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,251
<i>Now, the moment
we were all waiting for.</i>

35
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,876
<i>The stage is all set for a big fight.</i>

36
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,835
<i>There's palpable excitement in the air.</i>

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,876
<i>Both the wrestlers are walking,</i>

38
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,668
<i>for the fight.</i>

39
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,876
<i>You are absolutely right, Tom.</i>

40
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,376
<i>Looks like it's going
to be an interesting bout.</i>

41
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,251
<i>The crowd seems excited.</i>

42
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,710
<i>The wrestlers come face to face.</i>

43
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:09,876
<i>Let's see how it plays out.</i>

44
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,501
<i>The customary handshake.</i>

45
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,501
<i>The referee's whistle...
and the match begins!</i>

46
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,751
<i>He's down!</i>

47
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:26,043
<i>He's down!</i>

48
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,293
<i>An early thrashing
for the Russian wrestler.</i>

49
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,043
<i>Overconfidence can often
prove fatal.</i>

50
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:37,210
Bro, you want to try once more?

51
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,793
<i>Now, the wrestlers are gearing up
for the next round.</i>

52
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:55,126
<i>Yes, Tom, this match doesn't look
as easy as it had seemed.</i>

53
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,835
<i>Let's see what happens now.</i>

54
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:01,751
<i>Both wrestlers testing each other.</i>

55
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,418
<i>A great attack!
An equally superb defense.</i>

56
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:09,585
<i>And that was a magnificent move!</i>

57
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,626
<i>What an amazing move!</i>

58
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:15,210
<i>He didn't know what hit him.</i>

59
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,293
Here's an attack.

60
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,793
<i>And that's a counter-attack!</i>

61
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,168
<i>And it's over!</i>

62
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,793
<i>It's all over.</i>

63
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,085
<i>David has become Goliath,</i>

64
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,460
<i>and Goliath has become David here.</i>

65
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,960
<i>Well said, Torn.</i>

66
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:36,501
<i>No one expected such a quick defeat
for the Russian wrestler.</i>

67
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:37,668
<i>What a match!</i>

68
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:39,710
<i>This is top class wrestling.</i>

69
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,876
You are good.

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,085
You've just defeated
a state level champion.

71
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,626
Don't be disheartened buddy,

72
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:53,001
you've just lost to
a national level champion.

73
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543

There you go!

106
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:06,543
Merely building a good body
does not make a wrestler.

107
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:08,126
Come here, kid.

108
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:13,126
Wrestling runs in the blood,
you have to be born with it.

109
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,043
Here. Buy yourself some milk.

110

Bless you.

111
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:57,751
When there's no food on your plate
what will you eat? Medals?

112
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,876
No one gives a damn
about wrestling.

113
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,585
Just take up the job
you are being offered.

114
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:14,585
Why did you quit wrestling?

115
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:17,793
I had no choice.

116
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,460
Wrestling gave me respect, fame,

117
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:25,376
but it couldn't give me money.

118
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:28,251
So, I took up this job.

119
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:31,960
<i>Every wrestler dreams,</i>

120
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:34,418
<i>of bringing honor and
glory to the country.</i>

121
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,210
<i>But if the country offers no support,</i>

122
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,918
<i>how far can a wrestler go?</i>

123
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,751
It's not your fault that you
couldn't win a medal for your country.

124
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:05,501
How long will you let these
memories depress you?

125
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:15,960
What I couldn't do,
our son will.

126
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,085
He will win gold
for our country.

127
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,876
Our flag will fly the highest.

128
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,251
Mark my words.

129
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:37,460
<i>That day uncle was
as anxious as a student,</i>

130
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,960
<i>whose high school results
were due.</i>

131
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,168
Don't worry, brother.

132
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,376
It's going to be alright.

133
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,876
It's a girl.

134
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:06,585
<i>Uncle was hoping for a boy.</i>

135
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,293
<i>But a girl was born.</i>

136
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,501
It's okay.

137
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,960
You have a sister now, Omkar.

138
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,460
<i>I was genuinely happy.</i>

139
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,418
<i>But uncle was faking it.</i>

140
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,918
<i>And then it all started.</i>

141
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:26,251
<i>Suddenly everyone in the village
was an expert,</i>

142
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,543
<i>in the art of conceiving a boy.</i>

143
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:34,543
Feed a black cow sweets made
with white sesame seeds,

144
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,543
wrapped in maize flatbreads,
with your left hand, before sunrise.

145
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:38,876
A son, for sure!

146
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,376
Mahavir, here's a special prayer...
for a son.

147
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:45,335
Recite it daily.

148
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,918
Here... eat this.

149
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,751
Eat this!

150
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,543
Stop, will you.

151
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:56,126
Mahavir,

152
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,751
make sure you try only on a Sunday.

153
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,335
On all other days,
reign in your urges.

154
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,251
Got it?

155
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,126
<i>Neither did people stop
giving their advice,</i>

156
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,668
Here you go, son.

157
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:13,043
<i>Nor did uncle and aunt
stop acting on them.</i>

158
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:17,376
<i>The day of the delivery arrived
and so did half the village.</i>

159
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,543
<i>To take credit for a son.</i>

160
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:21,751
Geeta, you are going to
have a brother.

161
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,043
You can play with him.

162
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,460
It's a girl.

163
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:37,501
<i>But neither did uncle get a son,</i>

164
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,001
<i>nor the villagers, credit.</i>

165
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,085
<i>But, in all these
"unfailing techniques",</i>

166
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,001
<i>where did the fault lie?</i>

167
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,876
She must have fed a black buffalo
instead of a black cow.

168
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,501
Else, look at my cousin
from Rohtak.

169
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,501
She had three healthy boys
in three years.

170
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,960
If you say the prayer in reverse,

171
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,960
the results will also be reversed.

172
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:02,376
Self control is a virtue.

173
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,501
I told him to try only on Sundays.

174
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:10,335
He must have let
the reins free every day.

175
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,710
I couldn't give you a son...

176
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:22,543
It's not your fault.

177
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,835
And don't get me wrong.

178
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:30,835
Both, Geeta and Babita
are very dear to me.

179
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:38,960
But only a boy
can fulfill my dream.

180
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,460
<i>Years went by.</i>

181
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,876
<i>Uncle remained adamant,</i>

182
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,626
<i>he wanted a boy.</i>

183
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:07,960
<i>But maybe God was adamant too.</i>

184
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,043
<i>The third child was a girl,</i>

185
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,543
<i>and so was the fourth.</i>

186
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:26,043
<i>This time I too was dejected.</i>

187
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:44,460
Food is ready, papa.

188
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,293
Turn it over or it'll burn.

189
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:20,335
<i>After that uncle gave up on his
desire for a son, and on his dream too.</i>

190
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,543
Hey, Mahavir Singh-ji!

191
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,668
What's wrong with him?

192
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,460
Are you coming to watch
the wrestling match this evening?

193
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,210
No. You carry on.

194
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:41,876
Hey, Mahavir!

195
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,460
I've been blessed with a boy.

196
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,210
Here... have some sweets.

197
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,043
What happened?

198
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,460
Look how badly
they've been thrashed.

199
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:39,710
Say something!

200
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,043
Yes, look how badly
they've been thrashed.

201
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,793
They're all swollen and bruised.

202
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:45,501
Yes, they're all swollen and bruised.

203
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,960
Why did you beat them?

204
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,251
I didn't, uncle.

205
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:53,043
Geeta and Babita beat them up.

206
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:07,835
They started it.

207
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,668
He called me a loser
and Babita a witch.

208
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:12,626
So, we gave it to them.

209
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,376
They beat them so badly?
For such a trivial reason?

210
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:20,626
Yes, shouldn't have
beaten them so badly.

211
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,668
Please forgive them...
they're kids.

212
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:28,251
We are letting go because
they are your girls.

213
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,168
Move!

214
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:32,085
Got thrashed by girls!

215
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,376
Come here.

216
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:41,668
Come here!

217
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:48,460
We won't fight again, papa.

218
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:52,126
First tell me, how did you
manage to do it?

219
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:58,376
First, he called me a loser
but I remained quiet.

220
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,626
But then he called Babita a witch.

221
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,293
That was it.

222
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:04,043
I grabbed him and
punched him like this.

223
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,210
Then the other guy attacked.

224
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:09,751
I caught his hair
and shoved him down,

225
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,085
and dug my elbow in his back.

226
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,960
<i>They say that a twig is enough
to give hope to a drowning man.</i>

227
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:38,335
<i>Here, uncle had found
not one, but two lifeguards!</i>

228
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:53,168
All along, I was desperate for a son,

229
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:56,293
so he could win a gold
for the country.

230
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:02,960
But what didn't occur to me
is that gold is gold.

231
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,876
Whether a boy wins it, or a girl.

232
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:11,501
From now on, Geeta and Babita
will do no household chores.

233
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,418
Wrestling is in their blood.

234
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,751
From now on they will only wrestle.

235
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,251
Wrestling is for boys.

236
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:26,543
You think our girls are
any lesser than boys?

237
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,668
I've never ever seen girls wrestle.

238
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:34,251
What will the villagers say?

239
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:37,001
For how long will they talk?

240
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:42,335
What if the girls break
their hands and legs?

241
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,210
We'll fix them.

242
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,793
Where will the money come from?

243
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,460
I don't know.

244
00:19:56,043 --> 00:20:00,085
Don't ruin the girls' lives
for your passion.

245
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:07,126
Let me try for a year.

246
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,751
For this one year,
you bury your feelings.

247
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,960
If I'm proven wrong,

248
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,918
I'll bury my dream forever.

249
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,210
Be ready at 5am tomorrow.

250
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,418
Why, papa?

251
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,168
I want to feed you
your favorite snack, 'gol gappas'.

252
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:49,710
5am. Okay?

253
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,960
What did you do now?

254
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:56,835
I thought you did something.

255
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,126
Eat.

256
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,626
How is it?

257
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,335
It's a little less spicy, papa.

258
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,585
Alright, make it spicier.

259
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,960
Eat as much as you want right now.

260
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:26,043
Because from today, you will both
lead the life of a wrestler.

261
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:33,960
And wrestlers are not allowed,

262
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,460
pickled, oily and spicy food,

263
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,960
in fact,
all the food that you most love.

264
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,960
Consider this your last treat.

punished so severely,

293
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,460
for beating up a couple of boys.

294
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,418
He abused me.
Why did you have to beat him?

Will you press my legs please?

338
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:44,585
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

339
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:25,335
Always respect Mother Earth.

340
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,835
The more you respect it,

00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:31,251

345
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:09,668
<i>they needed to practice
with good wrestlers.</i>

346
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:14,710
Omkar?

347
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:16,585
Him?

348
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:18,460
Yes.

349
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Isn't that too much, brother?

350
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,918
It was bad enough that
you were making the girls wrestle.

351
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:26,418
Now you want
them to fight boys?

352
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,876
Yes or no?

353
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,793
I don't have the heart to say yes.

354
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:37,460
And, I don't have the courage
to say no.

355
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,793
Okay, then send him over.

356
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:50,460
Because of you both
I'm caught in the crossfire.

357
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:52,543
Stop complaining!

358
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:54,876
You are just caught
in the crossfire.

359
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,335
We've been pushed into war.

360
00:28:57,418 --> 00:28:58,376
Keep running!

361
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,835
Why has papa got him
to train with us?

362
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:03,960
This pint-sized boy is no challenge.

363
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:06,251
He looks like a 'TTSS' to me.

364
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:07,418
What does that mean?

365
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,501
Tall on Talk, Short on Strength.

366
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:16,085
'TTSS'... is it?

367
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,751
Go easy, I'm your little sister.

368
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:35,793
Yes... yes!

369
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:47,085
Don't mind me saying,

370
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,710
but your girls are a little weak.

371
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,126
Want to fight me?

372
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:52,835
I'll be right back.

373
00:30:45,168 --> 00:30:47,335
I don't understand your ways.

374
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:01,293
At one time, I can either be
their coach or their father.

375
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,126
When the coach is at work,

376
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:10,543
the father has to take a backseat.

377
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,460
Sorry for calling you 'TTSS'.

378
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:20,960
Sorry. my foot!

379
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:27,543
You think this is a joke?

380
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,876
He is throwing you down
and you are letting him?

381
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:32,626
When he attacks from the left,

382
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,710
why don't you stabilize yourself
on the left and defend?

383
00:31:36,376 --> 00:31:37,251
Sorry, Papa-

384
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:39,376
Child, this is wrestling,

385
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:42,043
three sorries and the game is over.

386
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,001
Come on.

387
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,543
Try again.

388
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:55,793
Where's the strength in you?

389
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,668
You are training the girls to wrestle,

390
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,668
I didn't say anything.

391
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,876
But I will not allow you to cook
chicken in my kitchen!

392
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,210
Try and understand.

393
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,418
Wrestlers require protein.

394
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:10,793
I don't care!

395
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,960
If meat is cooked in my kitchen,

396
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:14,376
I will stop eating.

397
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,585
You want your girls
to be weak wrestlers?

398
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,168
I don't know anything.

399
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,835
There's no way chicken will be
cooked in my kitchen!

400
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,918
Omkar!
- Yes.

401
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:27,626
Do you know how to cook?

402
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,376
No, uncle.

403
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,960
Then learn.

404
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,543
We don't have enough money
for their current diet.

405
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,668
How can we afford
chicken now?

406
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:38,876
What? Sell you chicken
worth 100 rupees for 20?

407
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,835
And I will benefit from this deal?

408
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,168
Why don't you explain the math?

409
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:48,793
Look, Geeta and Babita will eventually
become famous wrestlers.

410
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,168
And when people will find out that
they eat chicken from your shop,

411
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,335
where do you think
they'll buy chicken from?

412
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:58,001
That makes sense.

413
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,376
But just 20 rupees?

414
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:00,626
There are other shops too.

415
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,126
Wait... listen.

416
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,543
Let's make it 40.

417
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:08,126
I won't give a dime
more than 25.

418
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,876
I have browned the onions,

419
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,126
and now this pot
will not go back in my kitchen.

420
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:41,543
Now, put the chicken in the pot.

421
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:51,168
And let it cook on a slow flame.

422
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:03,460
It's to be eaten with rice.

423
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,085
But... it can also be
eaten with bread.

424
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,793
<i>Uncle was fulfilling his duty,</i>

425
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
<i>and the villagers, theirs.</i>

426
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:23,751
Girls are best suited
for the kitchen,

427
00:34:23,835 --> 00:34:24,960
not for wrestling.

428
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,668
Mahavir Singh has gone mad.

429
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,876
Not mad,

430
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,210
he's become shameless.

431
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:33,626
He's getting the girls to
wear shorts and fight boys.

432
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:37,751
Since you all started wrestling,
your walk has become very manly.

433
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,751
Wonder what else will happen?

434
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:43,626
Next, it'll be my fist
and your face.

435
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:48,626
If only you had
given birth to a boy!

436
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,251
Their mother doesn't protest either.

437
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:54,751
The entire village is laughing at us.

438
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,418
Who will marry our girls?

439
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:01,710
I will make our girls so capable,

440
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:03,835
that boys will not choose them,

441
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:05,376
they will choose boys!

442
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:11,418
I'm going to tell papa today,
this wrestling isn't working out.

443
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,751
Me, too.

444
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:15,585
B-O-Y... boy.

445
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:19,626
C-A-T... cat.

446
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,960
Papa, this wrestling
isn't working out...

447
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,751
for Babita.

448
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,418
Yes, papa... and,

449
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,418
Geeta gets so tired
that she falls asleep in class.

450
00:35:33,085 --> 00:35:36,585
She can't concentrate
on her studies at all.

451
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:39,793
Babita's body aches terribly.

452
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:42,501
She keeps tossing
and turning all night.

453
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:46,793
In school, girls tease
Geeta by calling her a man.

454
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:48,168
Sad, isn't it?

455
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:52,376
None of these
seem like a problem.

456
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:54,835
Tell me if there is
a real problem.

457
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:55,793
Read.

458
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:59,835
E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T

459
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:03,376
Papa, our hair is getting ruined
because of wrestling in the mud.

460
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,168
She even has lice.

461
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,793
I killed eight this evening.

462
00:36:13,543 --> 00:36:14,960
Now, that's a real problem.

463
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,960
Okay, be ready tomorrow at 5am.

464
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:23,876
Papa, please.

465
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:25,293
We don't have any problem.

466
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:27,501
In fact, we are enjoying it.

467
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,335
Please don't cut our hair.

468
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:31,501
We will do as you say.

469
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,085
Ma, say something.

470
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:34,793
Look what papa is doing.

471
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,460
Please don't cut our hair, papa.

472
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:38,668
We'll do whatever you say.

473
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,751
We'll wake up in the morning!

474
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:42,460
Do everything...
won't ever complain.

475
00:36:42,543 --> 00:36:44,460
Just don't cut our hair, please.

476
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:45,960
Please, papa.

477
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:48,335
Cut it.

478
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:49,835
Cut it?

479
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,335
Can you grow it?

480
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:55,168
Then cut it.

481
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,835
Getting them to wrestle
was still okay,

482
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,918
but it's cruel to chop their hair off!

483
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:28,126
They are girls, after all.

484
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:31,501
Whatever I'm doing
is for their best.

485
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,335
Anything that distracts them
from wrestling,

486
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:36,668
I will get rid of!

487
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:41,626
"Is that the full moon or the sun!"

488
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,710
I'm confused... today both
seem to have risen together.

489
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:47,751
Let it go, Babita.

490
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:50,251
Our stars are to blame.

491
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,126
Enough of wrestling,

492
00:38:58,293 --> 00:38:59,918
now, it's time for a street-fight!

493
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:04,460
<i>And then, in a small village
of Haryana called Balali,</i>

494
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:06,793
<i>a grand rebellion began.</i>

495
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:12,376
<i>Revolutionaries Geeta and Babita
versus dictator Mahavir Singh.</i>

496
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:17,251
<i>All of uncle's arsenal
were neutralized one by one.</i>

497
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:21,960
<i>The alarm clock was
cleverly misguided.</i>

498
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,543
What happened, papa?

499
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,001
You are late today.

500
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,876
Age is catching up.

501
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,293
No problem.

502
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:46,585
We've finished today's training.

503
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,168
Come, Babita.

504
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,251
<i>Countless light-bulbs were martyred.</i>

505
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:01,210
How come the bulb fuses everyday?

506
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:02,543
Quality... papa,

507
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,001
quality!

508
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,168
<i>Injury was made an ally.</i>

509
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:13,043
<i>In the battlefield, surrender
was given without a fight.</i>

510
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:16,126
Should I give it to you?

511
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,626
<i>And uncle, despite having both hands,</i>

512
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:22,043
<i>felt helpless like the armless character
from the film 'Sholay'.</i>

513
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,210
Get out of here!

514
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:29,043
<i>I couldn't understand how
I had suddenly become so strong.</i>

515
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:32,335
<i>But uncle understood very well
why Geeta and Babita,</i>

516
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:34,543
<i>had suddenly become so weak.</i>

517
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:39,460
<i>Geeta and Babita thought
that they had won the war.</i>

518
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:41,126
Hey!

519
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,668
Are you going to Sunita's wedding?

520
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,626
M... mummy.

521
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:48,835
Are you trying to embarrass me?

522
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,376
Choose one.

523
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:52,835
This one.

524
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,210
Let me see.

525
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Finally,
my girls are looking like girls.

526
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:12,376
Don't tell papa.

527
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:14,876
Come home before 8pm.

528
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,543

549
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:33,918
- Let it go, brother.

550
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,585
- He is crazy.

551
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:52,418
We missed training
just for a day.

552
00:43:52,918 --> 00:43:56,168
What was the need to create
such a big scene?

553
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:01,751
What kind of father forces
his daughters to become wrestlers?

554
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:05,335
Makes them wake up at 5am to run.

555
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:07,543
Works them like slaves.

556
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:09,251
Makes them fight boys.

557
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:12,168
And if they protest,
he cuts their hair.

558
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,126
May God never give
anyone such a father.

559
00:44:18,335 --> 00:44:20,835
I wish God had given me
such a father.

560
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:30,543
At least your father
thinks about you.

561
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:35,043
Otherwise, our reality is,

562
00:44:35,793 --> 00:44:37,668
the moment a girl is born,

563
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:40,376
teach her to cook and clean,

564
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:42,876
make her do
all the household chores.

565
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:47,001
And, once she turns 14,

566
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:50,168
marry her off.

567
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:53,418
Get rid of the "burden"!

568
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:57,335
And hand her over to a man,

569
00:44:58,335 --> 00:45:00,418
whom she has never seen before.

570
00:45:02,085 --> 00:45:04,418
Make her bear children
and raise them.

571
00:45:05,585 --> 00:45:07,168
That's all she's good for.

572
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,918
At least your father
considers you his child.

573
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,960
He is fighting against
the whole world.

574
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:15,876
He is silently tolerating
their taunts.

575
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:17,210
Why?

576
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:21,751
So that the two of you
can have a future... a life.

577
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:25,585
What is he doing wrong?

578
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:34,668
<i>♪ I'm here to stay. a'</i>

579
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,293

00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,126

583
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:52,876

a handful of days to prepare. a'</i>

584
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,376

00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:17,668
<i>♪ So, wrestle, O Wrestler! 4'</i>

588
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,293
<i>♪ Wrestle, O Wrestler! 4'</i>

589
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:24,501
<i>That day, one fact
became clear to me.</i>

590
00:47:24,585 --> 00:47:26,501
<i>Don't know about Geeta and Babita,</i>

591
00:47:26,918 --> 00:47:29,668
<i>but I sure didn't have
wrestling in my blood.</i>

592
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:33,793
Look at him sulk.

593
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:36,793
Give him some butter, ma.

594
00:47:36,918 --> 00:47:38,876
He's become so weak.

595
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:43,460
I lost intentionally to
make you happy.

596
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:44,835
Get lost... 'TTSS'!

597
00:47:44,918 --> 00:47:46,960
"Lost intentionally..."

598
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:48,960
Don't worry.

599
00:47:49,126 --> 00:47:50,751
It'll remain between us.

600
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,376
After all, you are family.

601
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:54,543
Your reputation is ours, too.

602
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:55,960
Don't get so cocky.

603
00:47:56,085 --> 00:47:56,960
Watch me tomorrow.

604
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,168
You won't be able to tomorrow.

605
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:03,085
No, uncle. Tomorrow, I will
definitely put up a tough fight.

606
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,710
We are going
to Rohtak tomorrow.

607
00:48:05,793 --> 00:48:06,751
For a wrestling competition.

608
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,501
But, I am not ready for
a wrestling competition yet.

609
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,043
Who is talking about you?

610
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:25,960
She will fight boys?

611
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,418
She won't last
two minutes, uncle.

612
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:29,585
Why?

613
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:31,168
Aren't you a boy?

614
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,668
She thrashed you.

615
00:48:42,918 --> 00:48:45,668
<i>I had seen a lot of wrestling
competitions in my life.</i>

616
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:48,251
<i>But today I was going to
witness a bout,</i>

617
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,293
<i>the likes of which, had never
been seen before in Haryana.</i>

618
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:54,501
<i>A riot was inevitable.</i>

619
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:01,460
Mr. Mahavir Singh Phogat...
welcome!

620
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:04,085
It's an honor that you have come
to watch the competition.

621
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,960
I've got a wrestler with me too.

622
00:49:06,085 --> 00:49:06,960
Name, please.

623
00:49:07,168 --> 00:49:08,960
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

624
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:11,835
What?

625
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:14,585
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

626
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,043
You'll make a girl wrestle?

627
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,251
Yes. So?

628
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:28,460
Write.

629
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:34,710
Sir, the day I organize
a cooking competition,

630
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:36,585
that day get Ms. Geeta along.

631
00:49:37,335 --> 00:49:38,918
This is a wrestling competition!

632
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:43,126
We have come from very far.

633
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,335
We won't return without a fight.

634
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:48,668
Either Geeta will fight,

635
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:49,835
or you and I.

636
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:53,085
First, you utter nonsense,
and then you are being stubborn too!

637
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:54,501
What do you mean?

638
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:56,126
You want a girl
to wrestle with boys?

639
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,626
You may not be bothered
about your honor, but we are.

640
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,501
I will have your honor
laid out now!

641
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,126
Please... sir.

642
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:08,043
Please... we really respect you, sir.

643
00:50:08,293 --> 00:50:11,251
But what you ask for,
can't happen.

644
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,585
We can't do this, brother.

645
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:29,001
Let's go.

646
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:31,835
How dare he...

647
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:36,460
You are getting a chance to
play the game,

648
00:50:36,543 --> 00:50:38,585
and you are giving a walkover?

649
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:40,543
Meaning?

650
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,126
How many years have we been
holding wrestling competitions?

651
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:44,043
Five.

652
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,501
How many people come to see?

653
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,085
Just a handful.

654
00:50:48,543 --> 00:50:49,085
So?

655
00:50:49,335 --> 00:50:51,085
Dimwit, think about it.

656
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:54,043
In a town that has never
seen a girl wrestle,

657
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,251
when a girl wrestles a boy,

658
00:50:57,335 --> 00:50:59,501
how many people
will come to watch?

659
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,710
Our competition will go
through the roof!

660
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,668
But what if the girl
breaks her arms or legs?

661
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:06,460
Let them break.

662
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,793
You bandage
your broken competition.

663
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:10,835
Even if you charge
two rupees per ticket,

664
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,876
your wrestlers will eat
for months.

665
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:18,751
Mahavir-ji!

666
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:23,751
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls!

667
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:29,835
You must have seen a girl
walk on fire, eat a snake.

668
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:32,918
But today, for the first time
in the history of Rohtak,

669
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:35,835
see a girl wrestling a boy
in a competition,

670
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:38,585
in half-an-hour, at Lal Chowk.

671
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:39,960
Tickets - two rupees.

672
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:42,043
A wrestling girl for two rupees!

673
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:44,918
You have to win!

674
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:51,126
Even if you were to pit
your boys against a lion,

675
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,043
there still wouldn't have been
such a crowd.

676
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:02,335
What do you think?

677
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:04,085
How many seconds
will she last?

678
00:52:04,335 --> 00:52:05,918
S... s... s...

679
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,626
Mate, by the time you finish
she'll be done and dusted.

680
00:52:11,043 --> 00:52:13,168
Will she fight in trunks like these?

681
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,251
Get lost!

682
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:17,918
I was just hoping.

683
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:20,543
Where is she?

684
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:24,043
She looks hot.

685
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:26,126
Hope her t-shirt doesn't tear.

686
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,460
I hope it does!

687
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:39,168
Go, Geeta!

688
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:45,126
- Her father has lost it!

689
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:49,043
Do you know
the rules of mud-wrestling?

690
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:52,585
Then choose who you
want to lose to.

691
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,751
Who do you think she'll pick?

692
00:52:59,835 --> 00:53:02,168
Our Scrawny Spider.

693
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:05,960
He will win for the first time.

694
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:21,460
Gosh, Jassi will beat her to pulp!

695
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:24,043
Three of you, out of here.

696
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,960
Your girl has lost it.

697
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,668
There is still time, stop her.

698
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,876
Or she'll go back on a stretcher.

699
00:53:34,751 --> 00:53:38,168
Before you fight a bout
you have to fight fear.

700
00:53:39,543 --> 00:53:41,751
At least, my girl has conquered fear.

701
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:44,376
Go easy, she's a girl.

702
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,251
Don't make that mistake.

703
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,543
Will you embarrass us?

704
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:27,793
Geeta, great going!

705
00:55:00,585 --> 00:55:02,001
W... wow!

706
00:55:16,335 --> 00:55:17,585
She's gone.

707
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,751
Wh... wh... what a save!

708
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,585
You fought well.

709
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,210
Excellent!

710
00:55:59,793 --> 00:56:03,585
The committee awards
the winning wrestler, Jassi,

711
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:06,460
with a cash prize of 20 rupees.

712
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:10,460
And from our patron, Kartar Singh,

713
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:14,293
a special prize for
Geeta Kumari of 50 rupees!

714
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:25,126
Sorry, Papa-

715
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,210
It's okay.

716
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:30,710
Come on.

717
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:41,001
You got lucky, or you'd have
gone home on a stretcher.

718
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:53,251
Papa.

719
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:59,210
When is the next fight?

720
00:57:29,626 --> 00:57:33,876

<i>Once again people had started
talking about Geeta and Babita.</i>

751
00:59:11,543 --> 00:59:15,751
These two girls come from Balali
and thrash boys.

752
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:18,251
This fellow lost to a girl.

753
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:20,126
Why don't you fight her?

754
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:23,876
<i>But this time the heckles were
replaced with applause!</i>

755
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:27,418
<i>Some did not want to
wrestle with the girls.</i>

756
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:33,001
<i>And some didn't allow
them to wrestle.</i>

757
00:59:33,085 --> 00:59:34,543
Please leave!

758
00:59:36,835 --> 00:59:38,710
<i>Geeta and Babita were winning
not just wrestling competitions,</i>

759
00:59:38,793 --> 00:59:40,793
<i>but hearts, too.</i>

760
00:59:54,793 --> 01:00:00,210
14,900... 15,000... 15,150.

761
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:05,126
You've become a senior wrestler!

762
01:00:06,585 --> 01:00:09,543
By getting selected to the
Haryana state team,

763
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:11,501
Geeta Kumari has brought fame
not only to our school,

764
01:00:11,585 --> 01:00:12,793
but to the entire district of Bhiwani.

765
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,710
And we are sure that,

766
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:18,501
she will make our town proud
in the National Sub-Juniors, too.

767
01:00:23,876 --> 01:00:26,668
Leave? For two months?

768
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:29,085
Is your daughter getting married?

769
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,876
I have to prepare
Geeta for the Nationals, sir.

770
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,751
Forget about it.

771
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:41,543
If she was getting married,
I might have considered.

772
01:00:45,043 --> 01:00:47,960
I don't understand your decisions.

773
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:50,460
I didn't have a choice.

774
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:53,251
I couldn't let go of my dream,

775
01:00:53,335 --> 01:00:55,001
so, I let go of the job.

776
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,543
What will you do now?

777
01:00:58,918 --> 01:01:01,751
I'll start farming
on our own plot of land.

778
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,126
It's hard work,

779
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,876
but at least I will be able
to give the girls time.

780
01:01:14,376 --> 01:01:17,168
Titu... put this in the car.

781
01:01:18,835 --> 01:01:20,626
Wait... go...

782
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:24,876
Yes, Mahavir Singh-ji,
what were you saying?

783
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:29,293
If I could get some funds,
it would help a lot.

784
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,418
My girl has now reached
the state level.

785
01:01:33,418 --> 01:01:33,876
So...

786
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,168
What is the big deal
in reaching state level?

787
01:01:36,418 --> 01:01:38,335
That too in ladies wrestling?

788
01:01:38,585 --> 01:01:42,085
Your daughter ran alone,
and came first.

789
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:46,043
What do you need the funds for?

790
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:51,626
Sir, I want to buy a mat
for her to train on.

791
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,835
She's playing well.

792
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:57,085
If you support her today,

793
01:01:57,168 --> 01:01:58,960
then one day, she will
make the nation proud.

794
01:01:59,168 --> 01:02:00,710
Look, Mahavir Singh-ji,

795
01:02:01,126 --> 01:02:03,585
we get this much
funding for sports.

796
01:02:04,126 --> 01:02:06,085
Wrestling gets this much.

797
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:07,585
Keep aside gents wrestling,

798
01:02:07,668 --> 01:02:11,168
then remove coaching, dieting,
traveling, equipment, etc.

799
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:13,501
All that remains for ladies wrestling
is this much.

800
01:02:14,585 --> 01:02:17,251
And for this much,
you bought me a box of sweets.

801
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,501
But you have our
complete support.

802
01:02:27,335 --> 01:02:29,418
The reason India
doesn't win medals,

803
01:02:30,418 --> 01:02:32,918
is because officers like you
are warming these seats.

804
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:35,751
Alright. I'll get up.

805
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,460
Titu, serve me lunch.

806
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:42,918
Mahavir Singh-ji,
care to join me for lunch?

807
01:02:49,626 --> 01:02:52,335
The Federation is a breeding ground
for such termites.

808
01:02:54,251 --> 01:02:56,960
They have ruined sports.

809
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:05,043
There is no support
for sports persons,

810
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:09,668
only abuses when you don't win.

811
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:14,043
Medalists don't grow on trees.

812
01:03:14,418 --> 01:03:16,668
You have to nurture them.

813
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,335
With love, with hard work,
with passion.

814
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:27,626
And here, the scoundrels don't
give money for even a mat.

815
01:03:29,626 --> 01:03:31,585
What is a mat, brother?

816
01:03:31,793 --> 01:03:35,460
Synthetic mattresses
on which wrestlers fight.

817
01:03:37,043 --> 01:03:40,168
A mattress is a mattress!

818
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:43,835
No?

819
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,418
Did I say something wrong?

820
01:03:56,335 --> 01:03:59,376
<i>Uncle had already ruined
our sleep, figuratively speaking.</i>

821
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:03,168
<i>Now he was hell bent
on doing it literally, too.</i>

822
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,960
Wrestling on a mat is different
from mud-wrestling.

823
01:04:21,293 --> 01:04:23,418
Now we have to wrestle
on the mat.

824
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:26,335
And in mat-wrestling
you have to score points.

825
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:31,710
You can score one, two,
three or five points.

826
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:33,835
Omkar...

827
01:04:37,918 --> 01:04:40,210
If you hold the opponent
by the waist,

828
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,293
and drop him to his knees,

829
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:44,668
then you score one point.

830
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:49,043
And from the ground position
if you roll him on to his back,

831
01:04:49,335 --> 01:04:50,793
then you score two points.

832
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:52,585
There are different ways
to do this.

833
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,918
Uncle!

834
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,918
Like this.

835
01:04:56,793 --> 01:05:00,251
Or from the ground position,
like this!

836
01:05:02,918 --> 01:05:09,085
If you flip your opponent on his back
from a standing position,

837
01:05:09,293 --> 01:05:11,543
then you will score three points.

838
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:14,210
Please, uncle!

839
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:16,001
Like this... three points.

840
01:05:16,085 --> 01:05:19,460
Like this... from standing position...
on to his back.

841
01:05:19,543 --> 01:05:23,668
To score five points is difficult,
but it can be done.

842
01:05:24,335 --> 01:05:26,751
If you flip your opponent
from a standing position,

843
01:05:27,085 --> 01:05:29,918
above your head
in a rainbow-like arc,

844
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:31,585
and have him fall on his back,

845
01:05:31,668 --> 01:05:33,585
then you score five points!

846
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:34,501
Watch.

847
01:05:34,585 --> 01:05:35,335
No... no, please, uncle!

848
01:05:35,418 --> 01:05:37,043
Come here.
- No, please.

849
01:05:41,585 --> 01:05:43,293
A real wrestling mat is not like this.

850
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:47,126
It's like this.

851
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,043
<i>We have to fight
in the yellow area.</i>

852
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:18,043
<i>The red zone is a danger area.</i>

853
01:06:19,168 --> 01:06:22,543
<i>If you step out of it,
you lose a point.</i>

854
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:33,085
<i>There are three rounds
of two minutes each.</i>

855
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:36,543
<i>Three rounds
of two minutes each.</i>

856
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:41,960
<i>Whoever wins two out of
three rounds, wins the match.</i>

857
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,751
Sir, your daughter is underweight.

858
01:06:50,543 --> 01:06:51,460
So?

859
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:52,960
Take my advice.
Go back.

860
01:06:53,251 --> 01:06:55,293
Feed her,

861
01:06:55,543 --> 01:06:57,960
fatten her and
come back next year.

862
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:01,376
If she fights like this,
she will break her bones.

863
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:05,001
You just tell me whether
she is allowed to wrestle or not.

864
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:08,460
Yes... she is.

865
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:10,251
Sign up.

867
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,460
Good move!

868
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:37,168
<i>Geeta had defeated beefy boys,</i>

869
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,168
<i>how long could these girls survive?</i>

870
01:07:43,251 --> 01:07:44,626
Is that a girl or a storm?

871
01:07:51,418 --> 01:07:55,918
"Sub-Junior National Champion"

"Junior Nationals"

873
01:07:58,543 --> 01:07:59,543
Is she underweight?

874
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:02,626
Yes... but how does it matter?

875
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:32,668
"Junior National Champion"

876
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:50,335
<i>Time flew by.</i>

877
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:54,835
<i>Geeta went from junior to senior.</i>

878
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:57,668
<i>And uncle,</i>

879
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,626
<i>from senior to senior-citizen.</i>

880
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,918
Go... Geeta!

881
01:09:07,835 --> 01:09:11,585
<i>Babita and I, went from
shorts to full length pants!</i>

882
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:37,668
Push... push her down!

883
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,085
Side throw!

884
01:09:55,918 --> 01:09:58,418

"National Champion"

Finally uncle's dream
has been achieved.

887
01:10:43,793 --> 01:10:46,585
Now we can all relax.

888
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:47,501
No.

889
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,335
My dream remains to be fulfilled.

890
01:10:53,043 --> 01:10:56,626
Every year sees
a National champion.

891
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,710
My dream will be fulfilled,

892
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:01,793
when you win gold,
not for yourself,

893
01:11:02,126 --> 01:11:04,210
but for your country.

894
01:11:08,168 --> 01:11:10,335
You can celebrate today.

895
01:11:10,418 --> 01:11:13,585
From tomorrow we start
preparing further.

896
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:20,626
Papa...

897
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:25,960
Need to speak to you.

898
01:11:26,543 --> 01:11:27,751
Tell me.

899
01:11:28,168 --> 01:11:29,460
Papa.

900
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,126
Now that I am a
National champion, so...

901
01:11:35,543 --> 01:11:36,418
So?

902
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,876
No, I mean,

903
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,418
all National champions
need to go to Patiala,

904
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:44,126
for further training.

905
01:11:44,543 --> 01:11:46,001
To the National Sports Academy.

906
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:47,543
What are you getting at?

907
01:11:47,626 --> 01:11:49,126
Tell me clearly.

908
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,335
I will have to go too, papa.

909
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:56,960
From now, I'll have to train there,

910
01:11:59,043 --> 01:12:01,543
under the national coach.

911
01:12:15,793 --> 01:12:17,335
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

912
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:18,960
Wrestling.

913
01:12:37,501 --> 01:12:39,293
The place looks good.

914
01:12:41,418 --> 01:12:42,835
Let's hope the coach is good too.

915
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:49,918
Girls, come on.

916
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:57,418
You all must be rejoicing,

917
01:12:57,501 --> 01:13:00,335
at the thought of
advanced training.

918
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,501
Well, forget about learning,

919
01:13:04,918 --> 01:13:06,376
first you have to learn to forget!

920
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:09,501
Forget the wrong training
you've received.

921
01:13:09,835 --> 01:13:11,960
Wrong diet, wrong exercise,
wrong technique.

922
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:14,835
And after forgetting all that,

923
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:16,793
your real training will begin,

924
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,501
with National Coach,
Pramod Kadam.

925
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,376
And you will only learn
what I teach you.

926
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:27,626
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

927
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:30,335
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

928
01:13:30,418 --> 01:13:31,501
Good.

929
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:32,960
Warm up.

930
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:34,585
Get me tea!

931
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:38,876
Come on, girls.

932
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,793
Energy... more energy!

933
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,710
Yes, that's the way.

934
01:13:43,793 --> 01:13:44,626
Keep it up!

935
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:46,210
Good.

936
01:13:46,293 --> 01:13:47,626
Namaste, sir.

937
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:50,668
Sir, I'm Mahavir Singh Phogat.

938
01:13:50,835 --> 01:13:52,418
Geeta's father.

939
01:13:53,585 --> 01:13:54,251
Okay.

940
01:13:54,543 --> 01:13:56,460
I'm the one who has trained her.

941
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:58,793
Yes... good.

942
01:14:00,668 --> 01:14:01,626
She's good.

943
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,543
Very strong, with a lot of stamina.

944
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,835
Where's my tea?

945
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,918
Come on... move it!

946
01:14:20,668 --> 01:14:21,918
Sir... one request.

947
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,960
If Geeta gets the right coaching,

948
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:28,543
she will definitely win
an international medal.

949
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,751
Geeta!

950
01:14:34,418 --> 01:14:38,543
There should be a 90 degree
angle between your calf and thigh.

951
01:14:38,918 --> 01:14:40,960
Who has taught you?

952
01:14:42,668 --> 01:14:44,960
Is this how you will win
an international medal?

953
01:14:49,835 --> 01:14:52,210
You came to drop her, right?

954
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,085
You've done that.

955
01:14:55,543 --> 01:14:56,960
Now leave the rest to me.

956
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:00,501
Don't waste my time!

957
01:15:39,126 --> 01:15:40,335
Is Geeta happy?

958
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:45,668
The institute must be
very big, isn't it?

959
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:51,418
Everyone there must be
a champion, isn't it?

960
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,835
And the facilities there
must be amazing, right?

961
01:15:55,043 --> 01:15:56,168
Have you trained today?

962
01:15:56,376 --> 01:15:58,460
Yes. And the coach
must be top notch?

963
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,418
You seem very eager
to go there.

964
01:16:02,918 --> 01:16:04,751
Remember, I'm still your coach.

965
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:09,043
Your first time
away from home?

966
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:14,043
Just you wait...
we'll have a blast.

967
01:16:15,918 --> 01:16:18,293
Girls, 'DDLJ' is showing on TV.

968
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:19,335
WOW!

969
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:21,251
Let's watch.

970
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,626
I'm going to sleep.

971
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:25,168
You can't say no
to Shah Rukh Khan.

972
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,793
It's a sin.

973
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,626
Come.

974
01:16:31,376 --> 01:16:36,210
"Raj, if this girl loves you,
she will turn to look at you."

975
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:38,043
Please turn.

976
01:16:40,043 --> 01:16:41,043
"Turn

977
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,418
Turn.

978
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:46,918
Turn.

979
01:16:47,793 --> 01:16:48,751
"Turn

980
01:16:49,668 --> 01:16:52,168
She turned!

981
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:07,460
Just grow your hair.
You will kill it.

982
01:17:08,168 --> 01:17:09,793
A rhino uses strength,

983
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,126
but the tiger uses both
strength and technique.

984
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,543
Be a tiger, not a rhino.

985
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:16,543

01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:39,501
Come here.

1029
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:43,918
Forget your papa's technique.

1030
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:46,210
Learn only what I teach you.

1031
01:19:46,293 --> 01:19:47,085
Got that?

1032
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:49,585
Hello!

1033
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:52,501
Sorry, Geeta has gone out.

1034
01:19:56,543 --> 01:19:59,793
For years I have been losing
to both of you intentionally.

1035
01:20:01,543 --> 01:20:03,001
It is the truth!

1036
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:07,168
That's it!
You see?

1037
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:10,585
Wrestlers shine only when
the technique is right.

1038
01:20:11,293 --> 01:20:12,918
Win the Nationals soon.

1039
01:20:13,168 --> 01:20:14,418
You too will be sorted.

1040
01:20:14,793 --> 01:20:17,001
Yes... when are you coming home?

1041
01:20:17,085 --> 01:20:18,793
I'm coming next week.

1042
01:20:19,126 --> 01:20:20,001
Need something?

1043
01:20:20,085 --> 01:20:21,543
Nothing. You get here.

1044
01:20:22,043 --> 01:20:23,001
Okay.

1045
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,168
Did you like it?

1046
01:20:32,418 --> 01:20:33,251
Really?

1047
01:20:33,335 --> 01:20:34,751
You grew out your hair.

1048
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:36,543
It's looking good.

1049
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:39,710
Your papa won't like it.

1050
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:45,251
Now everything can't work
the way papa wants.

1051
01:20:45,543 --> 01:20:46,876
Coach-sir didn't say anything.

1052
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:48,793
And he is such an accomplished coach.

1053
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:52,751
You do as you please over there.

1054
01:20:53,418 --> 01:20:54,710
Just be a little careful here.

1055
01:20:54,793 --> 01:20:55,501
Mummy,

1056
01:20:55,668 --> 01:20:57,835
real training happens
with a lot of freedom.

1057
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,376
Not with so many restrictions.

1058
01:20:59,585 --> 01:21:02,710
We watch movies,
television, eat out, too.

1059
01:21:02,876 --> 01:21:05,210
My performance hasn't suffered.

1060
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:07,293
I am the topmost wrestler
at the NSA.

1061
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,293
You home, wrestler?

1062
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:20,585
How are you?
- I am fine, papa.

1063
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,543
How's your training going?

1064
01:21:23,626 --> 01:21:25,876
She's going to Sydney for a fight.

1065
01:21:28,085 --> 01:21:29,543
How's your training going?

1066
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:31,293
It's going very well, papa-

1067
01:21:31,376 --> 01:21:32,751
You've seen...

1068
01:21:32,835 --> 01:21:34,835
I'm learning a lot of new things.

1069
01:21:34,918 --> 01:21:37,251
New strategy, moves,
technique...

1070
01:21:37,335 --> 01:21:38,335
very good.

1071
01:21:38,543 --> 01:21:41,668
I have thought that
I will teach her some things, too.

1072
01:21:42,626 --> 01:21:44,751
After all, she too has to
win the Nationals.

1073
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,793
You've grown your hair.

1074
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:52,960
Papa...
- No.

1075
01:21:54,835 --> 01:21:55,793
It's good.

1076
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:04,501
Don't just attack,
you've to defend, too.

1077
01:22:04,585 --> 01:22:05,710
Hold me.

1078
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:07,668
Now, how will you free yourself?

1079
01:22:07,876 --> 01:22:10,710
Hold this way, break and attack.

1080
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,543
Got that?

1081
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,710
That's an old technique.

1082
01:22:14,626 --> 01:22:15,418
Let me...

1083
01:22:17,293 --> 01:22:18,460
Hold me.

1084
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:20,751
Tight.

1085
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:24,126
Push your thumbs in this way,

1086
01:22:24,293 --> 01:22:25,251
and move it to the side.

1087
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:28,085
Not in the front... but to the side.
Break and attack.

1088
01:22:28,168 --> 01:22:30,210
What's wrong with my technique?

1089
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,210
What's wrong?

1090
01:22:32,293 --> 01:22:33,960
No, papa. It's not wrong.

1091
01:22:34,168 --> 01:22:37,168
This is more correct.
Coach-sir has taught it.

1092
01:22:37,335 --> 01:22:39,126
So now you are an expert?

1093
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:40,960
International?

1094
01:22:41,751 --> 01:22:43,126
Papa, I was...

1095
01:22:43,335 --> 01:22:46,960
I'd like to know, what is it that
your coach-sir has taught you,

1096
01:22:47,293 --> 01:22:48,793
that your father couldn't.

1097
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:54,210
Not her, show me.

1098
01:22:55,376 --> 01:22:56,501
Come on.

1099
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:01,168
Push your thumbs in this way...

1100
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:08,210
So, this is what your coach-sir
has taught you!

1101
01:23:08,543 --> 01:23:11,085
Is this how you'll win
an international medal?

1102
01:23:18,876 --> 01:23:19,918
I wasn't ready, papa.

1103
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,210
So, get ready.

1104
01:26:03,668 --> 01:26:05,793
This is what I was saying, papa.

1105
01:26:08,543 --> 01:26:10,043
Isn't there a difference?

1106
01:26:55,751 --> 01:26:57,626
What happened today
wasn't right.

1107
01:26:58,335 --> 01:27:00,001
What wasn't right?

1108
01:27:00,793 --> 01:27:02,376
This was bound to happen.

1109
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,293
Someone had to tell papa
that his techniques are weak.

1110
01:27:05,376 --> 01:27:07,751
His techniques aren't weak.

1111
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:09,835
He's become a little weak.

1112
01:27:10,001 --> 01:27:11,585
And don't forget that
you've won the Nationals,

1113
01:27:11,668 --> 01:27:13,751
based on his "weak" techniques.

1114
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,710
You can win the Nationals
with these techniques, Babita,

1115
01:27:18,335 --> 01:27:19,710
not international matches.

1116
01:27:19,793 --> 01:27:23,126
And the sooner
you realize this, the better.

1117
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:29,543
Alright.

1118
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:32,418
You keep faith in your techniques.

1119
01:27:32,835 --> 01:27:35,251
I still put my faith in papa.

1120
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:40,668
I pray to God that you fight
well at the Nationals.

1121
01:27:42,085 --> 01:27:45,710
And I pray that you do well
in your international tournament.

You don't look happy. Papa-

Didn't I fight properly?

No, my dear.

You fought exactly as I expected.

But, I never imagined Geeta
would fight like this.

And now, you too,
have won the Nationals.

You too, will go to NSA.

Come.

What did you fill in the bag?
- Let me get it.

It's so heavy.

Hi, Jasmeet!

This is my younger sister, Babita.

01:34:40,626 --> 01:34:43,501
Whoa! A family of wrestlers!

1190
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,210
Here is the mess.

1191
01:34:46,418 --> 01:34:48,043
This is were we hog.

1192
01:34:52,626 --> 01:34:54,168
This is the lounge.

1193
01:34:54,418 --> 01:34:57,043

My, aren't you eager!

1196
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:07,501
See it tomorrow.
Rest today.

1197
01:35:12,251 --> 01:35:13,876
Can I say something?

1198
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,251
Don't feel offended.

1199
01:35:16,543 --> 01:35:17,710
Tell me.

1200
01:35:18,251 --> 01:35:20,335
You've changed a lot.

1201
01:35:22,835 --> 01:35:27,085
I remember the first time
you lost a match.

1202
01:35:27,918 --> 01:35:29,876
You couldn't sleep all night.

1203
01:35:30,335 --> 01:35:34,335
And now, in spite of losing an
international fight you are...

1204
01:35:34,793 --> 01:35:39,126
I mean, it doesn't show
at all on your face.

1205
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:43,460
Has papa trained you
to say this?

1206
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:47,293
I remember papa's training
very well.

1207
01:35:48,168 --> 01:35:49,668
It seems you've forgotten.

1208
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,668
You focus on your training.

1209
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,543

You just couldn't win.

1226
01:37:00,168 --> 01:37:02,293
It doesn't mean you are
a bad wrestler.

1227
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:04,085
It happens.

1228
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,126
Some people are not made
for international victory.

1229
01:37:33,043 --> 01:37:34,835
Do you feel too,

1230
01:37:36,793 --> 01:37:38,960
that I'm not cut out
for an international medal?

1231
01:37:43,043 --> 01:37:45,293
I don't know about that.

1232
01:37:46,376 --> 01:37:48,335
All I know,

1233
01:37:49,126 --> 01:37:50,793
is that you are the girl,

1234
01:37:51,043 --> 01:37:53,293
who thrashed boys
in mud-wrestling.

1235
01:37:55,126 --> 01:37:56,501
You are the girl,

1236
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,668
who in spite of being
underweight, won sub-juniors.

1237
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:04,960
You beat everyone at the Nationals
for three straight years.

1238
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,585
If you are not cut out
for international victory,

1239
01:38:10,835 --> 01:38:14,793
then I don't know
which girl in India is.

1240
01:38:21,668 --> 01:38:24,460
I have a lot of faith in you,

1241
01:38:25,668 --> 01:38:29,835
but it's nothing compared to
the faith that papa has in you.

1242
01:38:31,835 --> 01:38:33,751
Talk to him once.

1243
01:38:36,751 --> 01:38:38,710
How do I face him?

1244
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,960
He's our papa.

1245
01:38:42,626 --> 01:38:44,418
At worst, what will happen?

1246
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:46,251
He will give you an earful.

1247
01:38:46,543 --> 01:38:47,835
Take it.

1248
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:51,460
His reprimands have
always helped us, haven't they?

1249
01:38:59,585 --> 01:39:00,960
Your medicine.

1250
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,626
I spoke to Babita.

1251
01:39:07,835 --> 01:39:10,418
She said the training
was going well.

1252
01:39:15,001 --> 01:39:16,043
And?

1253
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:20,585
Geeta is not okay.

1254
01:39:22,168 --> 01:39:23,918
Please talk to her once.

1255
01:39:40,835 --> 01:39:41,918
Hello.

1256
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:44,418
Geeta?

1257
01:39:46,168 --> 01:39:48,085
Okay, wait.

1258
01:39:49,918 --> 01:39:50,876
Geeta...

1259
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,835
Sorry, Papa-

1260
01:41:06,376 --> 01:41:10,543
Only six months remain for
the 19th Commonwealth Games,

1261
01:41:10,626 --> 01:41:13,210
the biggest sporting event in India.

1262
01:41:13,668 --> 01:41:19,126
What remains to be seen is how
the Indian players hold up,

1263
01:41:19,376 --> 01:41:22,460
against the world's best.

1264
01:41:41,543 --> 01:41:45,293
This time in the Commonwealth games,
I want three medals.

1265
01:41:45,585 --> 01:41:46,960
Now, whether they come
from you three,

1266
01:41:47,043 --> 01:41:48,335
you three or you three!

1267
01:41:48,543 --> 01:41:49,501
I don't care.

1268
01:41:49,585 --> 01:41:50,793
There are six months left.

1269
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,376
Give your best.

1270
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:53,710
Got that?

1271
01:41:54,085 --> 01:41:54,918
Get cracking!

1272
01:41:55,335 --> 01:41:56,210
Geeta.

1273
01:41:56,335 --> 01:41:57,168
Come here.

1274
01:42:00,668 --> 01:42:02,168
You will get one medal.

1275
01:42:02,251 --> 01:42:02,835
Yes, sir.

1276
01:42:02,918 --> 01:42:05,210
Not in the category
that you are losing in,

1277
01:42:05,293 --> 01:42:07,918
but in the category
in which you can win.

1278
01:42:08,168 --> 01:42:08,960
Got me?

1279
01:42:10,335 --> 01:42:13,543
It's difficult for you to survive
in the 55-kilo category.

1280
01:42:13,793 --> 01:42:16,293
You too must have
realised that by now.

1281
01:42:16,543 --> 01:42:17,876
In the 51-kilo category,

1282
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,876
you can hold your own,
and maybe win.

1283
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:24,251
Monitor everyone's diet strictly.

1284
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,793
No mess ups.
- Sir!

1285
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,043
Sir, I want to fight in the
55-kilo category!

1286
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,793
If you fight in the 55-kilo category
you'll get no where!

1287
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:40,210
She has to lose four kilos.

1288
01:42:40,293 --> 01:42:41,751
Change her diet.

1289
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,043
From tomorrow we'll start your
training for the 51-kilo category.

1290
01:42:45,418 --> 01:42:46,710
Come on, girls.

1291
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:52,585
Why won't you win
in the 55-kilo category?

1292
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:54,876
No need for you
to lose weight!

1293
01:42:55,126 --> 01:42:57,751
You will fight in the
55-kilo category, and win!

1294
01:42:58,126 --> 01:43:00,001
I'm coming to Patiala.

1295
01:43:07,335 --> 01:43:09,793
We don't know anyone in Patiala.

1296
01:43:10,126 --> 01:43:12,085
How will you stay for six months?

1297
01:43:12,376 --> 01:43:13,501
On rent.

1298
01:43:13,668 --> 01:43:14,793
And food?

1299
01:43:15,043 --> 01:43:16,043
I'll cook.

1300
01:43:16,126 --> 01:43:17,751
I'll cook, uncle!

1301
01:43:19,043 --> 01:43:21,043
I was thinking that
I too could come along.

1302
01:43:22,043 --> 01:43:23,168
What will you do there?

1303
01:43:23,585 --> 01:43:26,918
Well, in the past they did well
when they trained with me.

1304
01:43:27,085 --> 01:43:29,210
So, if they train with me
in the future too...

1305
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,501
Honestly, I think I am
their good luck charm.

1306
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:34,210
I mean... that's what I think.

1307
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:39,418
And, I will buy vegetables for you,
chop them for you,

1308
01:43:39,626 --> 01:43:42,043
run errands for you,
press your feet.

1309
01:43:42,418 --> 01:43:43,876
I'll make sure you are stress-free.

1310
01:43:44,043 --> 01:43:45,918
You see...
it's the Commonwealth Games.

1311
01:43:46,168 --> 01:43:47,626
We can't take any chances.

1312
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:54,668
Start preparing for gold!

1313
01:43:54,876 --> 01:43:57,585
"Patiala"

1314
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,710
The room is on top.

1315
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:04,543
Come.

1316
01:44:07,918 --> 01:44:09,960
Is there no other room,
in the same budget?

1317
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:11,293
It's nice.

1318
01:44:11,376 --> 01:44:12,543
Yes!

1319
01:44:12,626 --> 01:44:13,835
It's nice, indeed.

1320
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:15,168
I have to admit!

1321
01:44:20,335 --> 01:44:21,293
Yes?

1322
01:44:21,376 --> 01:44:25,585
Geeta and Babita Kumari's
father and close cousin.

1323
01:44:30,376 --> 01:44:32,501
Holy cow!

1324
01:44:40,501 --> 01:44:42,835
Uncle, doesn't this place
seem lovely?

1325
01:45:00,876 --> 01:45:02,085
How are you, champ?

1326
01:45:06,668 --> 01:45:07,376
And you?

1327
01:45:07,585 --> 01:45:08,751
I'm good, papa.

1328
01:45:10,335 --> 01:45:11,210
Why are you here?

1329
01:45:11,418 --> 01:45:12,960
Uncle insisted that I come.

1330
01:45:13,085 --> 01:45:15,418
He said it's the Commonwealth Games.
We can't take a chance.

1331
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:16,710
Shut up, 'TTSS'!

1332
01:45:19,168 --> 01:45:21,543
Geeta's 51-kilo category
training has started,

1333
01:45:21,668 --> 01:45:22,960
and the diet too.

1334
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,085
You continue their diet and training,

1335
01:45:27,543 --> 01:45:29,960
I'll supplement the rest.

1336
01:45:32,418 --> 01:45:34,335
What time does
your training start?

1337
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:35,585
7am.

1338
01:45:36,543 --> 01:45:37,585
Okay.

1339
01:45:37,793 --> 01:45:39,293
Be ready at 5am tomorrow.

Straight attacks won't do.

1357
01:47:12,085 --> 01:47:14,126
You have to play with
the opponent's mind.

1358
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:19,418
Fake a move...
but make another.

1359
01:47:35,126 --> 01:47:36,668
Sir, I had put her on a diet,

1360
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:38,876
but, I don't know why
it hasn't reduced.

1361
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,626
What have you been up to, Geeta?

1362
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,793
Will you say something
or just keep crying?

1363
01:47:57,335 --> 01:48:01,501
Sir, judging by their actions
I feel they don't need NSA.

1364
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:04,668
The rest is up to you.

1365
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,251
Do you all have anything to say?

1366
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,293
So you admit you are at fault.

1367
01:48:16,835 --> 01:48:19,043
Sir, they have just one fault.

1368
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,001
That their father is crazy.

1369
01:48:23,418 --> 01:48:26,960
He is so crazy about getting
a gold for the country,

1370
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,585
that in their childhood itself
he snatched away their toys,

1371
01:48:30,918 --> 01:48:32,543
and made them wrestle.

1372
01:48:33,876 --> 01:48:36,168
When they resisted,
he cut their hair off.

1373
01:48:36,668 --> 01:48:39,710
In order to prepare them,
he made them wrestle boys.

1374
01:48:40,085 --> 01:48:42,543
Took the taunts and abuses
of the entire village,

1375
01:48:43,585 --> 01:48:45,876
just so that one day they would
make the country proud.

1376
01:48:55,418 --> 01:48:56,585
Look, sir.

1377
01:48:56,918 --> 01:48:57,585
Look.

1378
01:48:57,918 --> 01:48:59,793
These 50 rupees
she won at Rohtak.

1379
01:49:00,085 --> 01:49:01,460
This in Hisar.

1380
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:04,085
This in Chandigarh.

1381
01:49:04,751 --> 01:49:08,668
This... this, all this... sir.

1382
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:12,835
These girls have traveled
a long way to reach here, sir.

1383
01:49:13,293 --> 01:49:15,960
Now don't tell them to turn back.

1384
01:49:16,543 --> 01:49:17,876
It's all my fault.

1385
01:49:18,168 --> 01:49:19,793
I humbly apologise.

1386
01:49:28,168 --> 01:49:30,543
Coach-sir is just concerned
with getting three medals.

1387
01:49:30,751 --> 01:49:32,585
No matter if they are bronze.

1388
01:49:33,251 --> 01:49:35,918
But I want our country
to win gold.

1389
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:38,835
And this girl can do it, sir.

1390
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,376
All of you, please wait outside.

1391
01:50:02,085 --> 01:50:04,501
You've made a mistake
by wasting time.

1392
01:50:05,918 --> 01:50:08,876
In 55-kilos, Geeta won't even
get selected for India.

1393
01:50:10,043 --> 01:50:12,585
If she had fought in the 51-kilos
she could've won a medal.

1394
01:50:13,376 --> 01:50:17,960
She should've won a medal
much earlier, in 55-kilos itself.

1395
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:20,043
You are responsible for that!

1396
01:50:20,335 --> 01:50:21,293
What did I do wrong?

1397
01:50:21,501 --> 01:50:23,876
Geeta's natural game is attacking.

1398
01:50:24,668 --> 01:50:28,751
By putting technique above instinct,
you've changed her game.

1399
01:50:29,293 --> 01:50:32,376
It's like telling a tiger
to fight like an elephant.

1400
01:50:33,876 --> 01:50:36,793
You'll be left with neither
a tiger nor an elephant.

1401
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,210
So, why don't you tell me,

1402
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:40,793
how to fight to win a medal!

1403
01:50:41,043 --> 01:50:45,210
With your permission, I would like to
demonstrate it here and now.

1404
01:50:45,585 --> 01:50:46,918
They're calling you inside.

1405
01:50:51,335 --> 01:50:52,710
What happened was wrong.

1406
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,543
But the committee has decided
to give them another chance.

1407
01:50:55,710 --> 01:50:56,543
Thank you, sir.

1408
01:50:56,668 --> 01:50:58,960
But, from today,

1409
01:50:59,626 --> 01:51:01,918
neither are you allowed
to enter the NSA premises,

1410
01:51:02,335 --> 01:51:05,335
nor are they allowed
to step out.

1411
01:51:09,251 --> 01:51:10,168
Okay, sir.

1412
01:51:16,585 --> 01:51:19,126
Today, make one for me too, uncle.

1413
01:51:22,126 --> 01:51:23,168
Sorry.

1414
01:51:29,585 --> 01:51:30,626
Thank you.

1415
01:51:35,793 --> 01:51:37,501
We had come to play the lead role,

1416
01:51:37,585 --> 01:51:40,251
NSA made ours
a guest appearance.

1417
01:51:40,793 --> 01:51:42,585
Let's head back now.

1418
01:51:43,251 --> 01:51:44,626
No, Omkar.

1419
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:47,960
They can stop me
from going inside,

1420
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:52,543
but no one can stop me
from coaching Geeta.

1421
01:51:54,001 --> 01:51:54,960
Cheers, uncle.

1422
01:51:57,335 --> 01:51:59,251
Against three of them
I held my own.

1423
01:51:59,418 --> 01:52:01,835
But the one who
took me to the cleaners...

1424
01:52:01,918 --> 01:52:05,418
she was smaller than me
and not that strong either.

1425
01:52:05,585 --> 01:52:07,251
Do you have a recording
of this match?

1426
01:52:07,418 --> 01:52:09,543
Yes papa, in the library.

1427
01:52:09,626 --> 01:52:11,710
Courier me a copy of all.

1428
01:52:18,335 --> 01:52:21,501
Only three months remain
for the Delhi Commonwealth Games.

1429
01:52:21,585 --> 01:52:25,793
And the fervor can be sensed at the
National Sports Academy in Patiala.

1430
01:52:28,376 --> 01:52:30,376
Where are we going, uncle?

1431
01:52:31,918 --> 01:52:34,751
<i>The one thing
I disliked about uncle,</i>

1432
01:52:35,126 --> 01:52:37,460
<i>was his constant
air of suspense.</i>

1433
01:52:37,585 --> 01:52:39,876
<i>It could kill you!</i>

01:53:00,751 --> 01:53:01,210
Yes?

1441
01:53:01,293 --> 01:53:03,918
How much for all the tickets
of the next show?

1442
01:53:04,751 --> 01:53:07,043
Which film do you
want to watch?

1443
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:08,710
We've brought it with us.

1444
01:53:12,668 --> 01:53:13,918
Pause.

1445
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:19,460
Play.

1446
01:53:32,793 --> 01:53:33,668
Are you done?

1447
01:53:33,751 --> 01:53:34,876
Be happy-

1448
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,668
Your next show is sold-out too.

1449
01:53:36,876 --> 01:53:39,918
What are you guys up to?

1450
01:53:40,126 --> 01:53:42,210
I mean, where is the movie from?

1451
01:53:42,376 --> 01:53:45,418
Atlanta... Indonesia.

1452
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:46,751
Imported?
- Yes.

1453
01:53:46,835 --> 01:53:48,960
Listen, can I make a copy?

1454
01:53:49,043 --> 01:53:50,960
Give me 50 rupees less.

1455
01:53:55,626 --> 01:53:58,501
How will she win
if she fights like this?

1456
01:53:59,168 --> 01:54:00,460
Uncle!

1457
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:05,543
Uncle, you've gathered
the knowledge,

1458
01:54:05,835 --> 01:54:07,460
but how will you pass it on?

1459
01:54:07,543 --> 01:54:10,376
NSA has issued a 'shoot-at-sight'
order against you.

1460
01:54:13,085 --> 01:54:14,043
Sit.

1461
01:54:15,085 --> 01:54:16,543
<i>Again... suspense!</i>

1462
01:54:17,293 --> 01:54:18,876
Is this how you fight?

1463
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,751
Like a quivering kitten?

1464
01:54:21,418 --> 01:54:23,626
If this is how you want to fight,
then don't.

1465
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:24,793
What happened, papa?

1466
01:54:24,876 --> 01:54:27,168
I saw all your matches.

1467
01:54:27,793 --> 01:54:30,085
You weren't wrestling,
that's for sure!

1468
01:54:31,168 --> 01:54:34,126
Do you have copies of
the DVDs that you gave me?

1469
01:54:34,501 --> 01:54:35,460
Yes, papa.

1470
01:54:35,626 --> 01:54:38,043
Can you arrange to watch
them alone?

1471
01:54:38,335 --> 01:54:39,793
I'll borrow a laptop.

1472
01:54:40,501 --> 01:54:41,335
Alright.

1473
01:54:41,543 --> 01:54:43,210
Be ready at 5am tomorrow.

1474
01:54:48,751 --> 01:54:50,668
It's been a while since
papa gave me an earful.

1475
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:53,335
Felt good.

1476
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,793
Play the Jakarta fight, round one.

1477
01:54:58,210 --> 01:54:59,210
I have, papa.

1478
01:54:59,376 --> 01:55:01,376
Go to three minutes 58 seconds.

1479
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,876
You have a lead
of two points,

1480
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,710
and you started
playing defensive.

1481
01:55:08,376 --> 01:55:09,835
Play. Look.

1482
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:14,001
Threw away the lead, didn't you?

1483
01:55:15,918 --> 01:55:18,876
When the opponent is trailing,
go for the jugular!

1484
01:55:26,293 --> 01:55:27,460
How did you do that?

1485
01:55:28,918 --> 01:55:32,501
Alternately, when you should be defending,
you are attacking and giving away points.

1486
01:55:32,876 --> 01:55:35,501
You will gain nothing by
desperately chasing after points.

1487
01:55:35,835 --> 01:55:37,960
You'll have to apply your mind.

1488
01:55:38,210 --> 01:55:40,626
You've lost matches
that were yours to win!

1489
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:49,751
Go... Geeta!

1490
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:52,668
"National Trials, Patiala"

1491
01:56:07,001 --> 01:56:09,835
Each round consists of two minutes.

1492
01:56:10,543 --> 01:56:15,376
However, there are 120 seconds
in those two minutes.

1493
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:20,335
Wait for that one second
when the opponent makes a mistake.

1494
01:56:24,751 --> 01:56:26,793
She's good. Isn't she?

1495
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:28,793
Yes, sir.

1496
01:56:30,376 --> 01:56:31,460
Very good!

1497
01:56:35,835 --> 01:56:38,168
Now you look ready, sis.

1498
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:40,585
Did you tell papa?

1499
01:56:41,376 --> 01:56:42,335
What did he say?

1500
01:56:43,376 --> 01:56:45,543
"There's no need to get too happy!"

1501
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:55,793
<i>A grand opening ceremony
to the 2010 Commonwealth Games!</i>

1502
01:56:58,085 --> 01:57:01,960
<i>Host nation, India, displaying
her ancient culture.</i>

1503
01:57:02,251 --> 01:57:04,835
<i>A proud moment indeed!</i>

1504
01:57:09,293 --> 01:57:12,335
<i>And here comes
the Indian contingent!</i>

1505
01:57:17,626 --> 01:57:20,960
<i>A huge welcome for them.</i>

1506
01:57:24,085 --> 01:57:27,460
<i>Let us remind you that
the finest athletes,</i>

1507
01:57:27,543 --> 01:57:30,251
<i>from 72 countries are participating.</i>

1508
01:57:30,835 --> 01:57:34,418
<i>We'll be back tomorrow
to start off the events.</i>

1509
01:57:34,793 --> 01:57:36,876
<i>Until then... goodnight!</i>

1510
01:57:42,668 --> 01:57:46,293
<i>Geeta was quite nervous
before her first bout.</i>

1511
01:57:46,751 --> 01:57:48,376
<i>And that was expected.</i>

1512
01:57:48,585 --> 01:57:52,876
<i>So far her performance
in international events had been poor.</i>

1513
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:58,001
<i>However little... the nation
still had hope on her.</i>

1514
01:57:59,085 --> 01:58:01,876
<i>And this was probably
Geeta's last opportunity,</i>

1515
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:03,418
<i>to prove herself.</i>

1516
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:12,418
<i>The first match in women's wrestling,
55-kilo category, is between,</i>

1517
01:58:12,585 --> 01:58:16,293
<i>India's Geeta Kumari and
Melissa Anderson from Wales.</i>

1518
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:17,918
Go, Geeta!

1519
01:58:18,335 --> 01:58:20,168
<i>Geeta seems quite nervous.</i>

1520
01:58:20,335 --> 01:58:22,793
<i>Now, let's see if she can
break her jinx,</i>

1521
01:58:22,876 --> 01:58:26,793
<i>of losing in the first
couple of rounds.</i>

1522
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:29,085
<i>We would like to remind
our spectators,</i>

1523
01:58:29,168 --> 01:58:31,543
<i>that there will be three rounds
of two minutes each.</i>

1524
01:58:32,293 --> 01:58:35,418
<i>Whoever wins two rounds,
wins the match.</i>

1525
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,543
<i>With that the match begins.</i>

1526
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:44,585
<i>Both the wrestlers are quite alert.</i>

1527
01:58:52,793 --> 01:58:54,335
<i>1 point to Melissa.</i>

1528
01:58:54,418 --> 01:58:56,876
<i>Melissa - 1; Geeta - O.</i>

1529
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:04,960
<i>Melissa seems stronger.</i>

1530
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:08,251
<i>3 more points to Melissa!</i>

1531
01:59:08,335 --> 01:59:09,501
What are you doing, Geeta?

1532
01:59:10,835 --> 01:59:12,626
<i>Melissa - 4; Geeta - O.</i>

1533
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:14,960
<i>If Geeta gives away
2 more points,</i>

1534
01:59:15,043 --> 01:59:18,335
<i>Melissa will win this round
on technical superiority.</i>

1535
01:59:24,543 --> 01:59:26,668
<i>And Melissa gets 2 points!</i>

1536
01:59:28,876 --> 01:59:30,960
<i>Exactly as we feared.</i>

1537
01:59:31,501 --> 01:59:36,376
<i>Melissa has won the first round
on technical superiority; 6-0.</i>

1538
01:59:37,335 --> 01:59:38,376
What are you doing, Geeta?

1539
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,793
Don't lose so badly!

1540
01:59:41,501 --> 01:59:44,710
<i>We now need to see that
after losing the first round badly,</i>

1541
01:59:44,793 --> 01:59:47,626
<i>is Geeta capable of making
a comeback in round two.</i>

1542
01:59:56,168 --> 01:59:57,960
<i>2 points to Melissa.</i>

1543
01:59:59,626 --> 02:00:01,376
<i>1 more point to Melissa.</i>

1544
02:00:01,918 --> 02:00:05,543
<i>The match seems to be
slipping out of Geeta's hands.</i>

1545
02:00:07,043 --> 02:00:08,793
You are not to lose, Geeta!

1546
02:00:16,501 --> 02:00:17,876
Come on, Geeta.

1547
02:00:21,793 --> 02:00:23,501
<i>Geeta, lagging by 3 points.</i>

1548
02:00:23,876 --> 02:00:25,668
<i>She'll have to score real quick.</i>

1549
02:00:34,335 --> 02:00:36,085
<i>2 points to Geeta!</i>

1550
02:00:36,668 --> 02:00:39,251
<i>Melissa - 3; Geeta - 2.</i>

1551
02:00:39,710 --> 02:00:41,876
<i>Geeta tries to score some more,</i>

1552
02:00:42,418 --> 02:00:43,960
<i>but the referee blows the whistle.</i>

1553
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,376
<i>The round is nearing completion.</i>

1554
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:48,501
<i>Geeta is still behind by a point.</i>

1555
02:00:55,501 --> 02:00:58,251
<i>Geeta in trouble!</i>

1556
02:01:01,043 --> 02:01:02,960
<i>Geeta gets 3 points!</i>

1557
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:05,626
<i>Geeta - 5; Melissa - 3.</i>

1558
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:11,126
<i>Just four seconds to go.</i>

1559
02:01:12,501 --> 02:01:13,751
Yes, Geeta!

1560
02:01:16,793 --> 02:01:19,293
<i>Geeta's back in the match!</i>

1561
02:01:19,376 --> 02:01:21,501
<i>It's one round each.</i>

1562
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:27,001
<i>Geeta has shown that she is not
going to accept defeat so easily.</i>

1563
02:01:27,543 --> 02:01:30,335
It's the last round.

1564
02:01:30,793 --> 02:01:32,585
Play defensive.

1565
02:01:34,918 --> 02:01:35,918
Got it?

1566
02:01:36,418 --> 02:01:37,835
Play attacking!

1567
02:01:46,626 --> 02:01:48,126
<i>And the last round begins.</i>

1568
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:51,085
<i>Geeta on the attack.</i>

1569
02:01:54,626 --> 02:01:56,043
<i>1 point for Geeta.</i>

1570
02:01:56,501 --> 02:01:59,001
<i>Geeta - 1; Melissa - O.</i>

1571
02:02:08,501 --> 02:02:10,335
<i>2 more points in Geeta's kitty.</i>

1572
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:12,918
<i>Geeta- 3; Melissa - 0.</i>

1573
02:02:13,543 --> 02:02:16,376
<i>Will she manage to keep her lead?</i>

1574
02:02:17,835 --> 02:02:19,376
Very good. Defend now.

1575
02:02:27,918 --> 02:02:29,585
<i>3 points for Melissa!</i>

1576
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:31,001
I told you to defend.

1577
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:33,001
No problem.
Keep attacking!

1578
02:02:33,085 --> 02:02:35,043
<i>The score is equal at 3-3.</i>

1579
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,460
Go for it, Geeta!

1580
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,251
<i>This match can tilt either way.</i>

1581
02:02:42,626 --> 02:02:47,001
<i>Geeta was poised to win
but lost her lead.</i>

1582
02:02:49,876 --> 02:02:51,585
<i>Geeta's in danger.</i>

1583
02:02:52,585 --> 02:02:53,710
<i>Wow! What a move!</i>

1584
02:02:53,793 --> 02:02:55,126
<i>3 points to Geeta!</i>

1585
02:02:55,210 --> 02:02:56,835
Keep her down, Geeta.

1586
02:03:02,835 --> 02:03:06,376
<i>Geeta has won this match!</i>

1587
02:03:08,293 --> 02:03:11,376
<i>India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,</i>

1588
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:17,251
<i>has proven her critics wrong.</i>

1589
02:03:18,918 --> 02:03:24,793
<i>A proud moment for Geeta's father,
Mahavir Singh Phogat!</i>

1590
02:03:34,126 --> 02:03:35,626
So far India has won,

1591
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:39,001
five gold, 13 silver
and seven bronze medals.

1592
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:41,793
In women's wrestling,
India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,

1593
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:45,585
has entered the semi-finals
of the 55-kilo category.

1594
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:50,293
Geeta will now face
Nigeria's Naomi Edwards,

1595
02:03:50,376 --> 02:03:52,418
two time world champion.

1596
02:03:53,043 --> 02:03:53,876
What do you think?

1597
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:56,501
Naomi is a very strong wrestler.

1598
02:03:56,585 --> 02:03:58,960
Extremely aggressive and attacking.

1599
02:03:59,501 --> 02:04:04,251
She doesn't give any
opportunity to her opponent.

1600
02:04:08,543 --> 02:04:12,001
It's not going to be easy
for Geeta this time.

1601
02:04:17,251 --> 02:04:19,335
Today, you played as per your will.

1602
02:04:19,543 --> 02:04:21,918
Now, do as I say.

1603
02:04:22,501 --> 02:04:24,168
Or it's impossible to win.

1604
02:04:24,251 --> 02:04:26,751
It's a difficult one,

1605
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:28,626
but not impossible.

1606
02:04:29,793 --> 02:04:32,293
You'll have to play offensive!

1607
02:04:32,418 --> 02:04:34,293
You have to play defensive.

1608
02:04:34,376 --> 02:04:35,918
Just go for the points!

1609
02:04:36,001 --> 02:04:38,376
Don't go for the points.

1610
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,376
You'll get a lot of opportunities.

1611
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:43,918
Don't give her any opportunities
because she won't give you any.

1612
02:04:44,251 --> 02:04:46,418
Force a lock-jam each time.

1613
02:04:47,210 --> 02:04:49,501
If she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated,

1614
02:04:49,835 --> 02:04:51,210
and will give you an opportunity.

1615
02:04:51,376 --> 02:04:54,293
That's the moment
we should grab!

1616
02:04:55,376 --> 02:04:58,668
<i>The first semi-final match in
the 55-kilo category.</i>

1617
02:04:58,918 --> 02:05:02,918
<i>India's Geeta Kumari
versus Nigeria's Naomi Edwards.</i>

1618
02:05:06,835 --> 02:05:09,210
<i>Naomi attacking from the start.</i>

1619
02:05:10,126 --> 02:05:12,960
<i>And against her nature,
Geeta playing defensive.</i>

1620
02:05:14,626 --> 02:05:16,210
<i>Naomi attacks!</i>

1621
02:05:16,293 --> 02:05:18,251
<i>Geeta in trouble.</i>

1622
02:05:18,335 --> 02:05:21,210
<i>Geeta putting up a strong defense.</i>

1623
02:05:21,501 --> 02:05:23,501
<i>Geeta holding her back.</i>

1624
02:05:28,876 --> 02:05:30,918
<i>Naomi made a strong attempt.</i>

1625
02:05:31,168 --> 02:05:33,210
<i>But Geeta held her own.</i>

1626
02:05:33,876 --> 02:05:35,126
Go on the attack!

1627
02:05:35,876 --> 02:05:37,126
Go easy.

1628
02:05:38,668 --> 02:05:40,043
<i>Naomi gets rough.</i>

1629
02:05:40,418 --> 02:05:42,210
<i>She seems frustrated.</i>

1630
02:05:43,668 --> 02:05:46,085
<i>Naomi twisting Geeta's wrist.</i>

1631
02:05:52,085 --> 02:05:56,293
<i>Naomi is being given a warning.</i>

1632
02:05:56,376 --> 02:05:58,043
Hang in there, Geeta!

1633
02:06:10,293 --> 02:06:11,960
<i>That's 3 points for Naomi!</i>

1634
02:06:12,876 --> 02:06:15,126
<i>Geeta had been
holding her off well.</i>

1635
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:16,335
<i>A really good effort,</i>

1636
02:06:16,418 --> 02:06:18,460
<i>but Naomi's broken
through her defense.</i>

1637
02:06:20,626 --> 02:06:23,418
<i>Geeta has to act fast.</i>

1638
02:06:29,835 --> 02:06:31,335
<i>Geeta takes Naomi down.</i>

1639
02:06:31,418 --> 02:06:32,501
<i>1 point to Geeta!</i>

1640
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:34,085
<i>She's still trying.</i>

1641
02:06:40,168 --> 02:06:41,835
<i>And time's up!</i>

1642
02:06:42,126 --> 02:06:45,501
<i>Geeta played well,
but she's lost this first round.</i>

1643
02:06:46,251 --> 02:06:47,335
What are you doing, Geeta?

1644
02:06:47,793 --> 02:06:49,126
Why don't you attack?

1645
02:06:56,335 --> 02:06:58,668
<i>The second round begins.</i>

1646
02:07:06,418 --> 02:07:07,585
<i>Naomi attacks.</i>

1647
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:26,335
<i>Naomi tries to flip Geeta.</i>

1648
02:07:26,418 --> 02:07:28,835
<i>But Geeta defends well.</i>

1649
02:07:32,543 --> 02:07:34,293
<i>Naomi puts all her strength,</i>

1650
02:07:34,585 --> 02:07:37,460
<i>but Geeta isn't giving her a chance.</i>

1651
02:07:38,335 --> 02:07:40,668
<i>This is an exciting match.</i>

1652
02:07:42,126 --> 02:07:44,335
<i>Naomi trying hard,</i>

1653
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:46,960
<i>but Geeta not giving her space.</i>

1654
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:50,668
<i>Naomi attacks again.</i>

1655
02:07:51,085 --> 02:07:52,626
<i>Geeta defends.</i>

1656
02:08:00,293 --> 02:08:02,460
<i>A nice defense by Geeta.</i>

1657
02:08:15,751 --> 02:08:17,751
<i>The referee breaks the fight.</i>

1658
02:08:17,835 --> 02:08:20,168
<i>Second round is still O-O.</i>

1659
02:08:20,876 --> 02:08:26,543
<i>Naomi must be wondering
how to break Geeta's defense.</i>

1660
02:08:30,168 --> 02:08:33,043
<i>"If she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated,</i>

1661
02:08:33,335 --> 02:08:34,210
<i>and will give you an opportunity."</i>

1662
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:35,960
<i>Naomi attacks.</i>

1663
02:08:37,168 --> 02:08:39,210
<i>"That's the moment
we should grab!"</i>

1664
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:44,543
<i>3 Points!</i>

1665
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:48,710
<i>And Geeta wins this round, 3-0.</i>

1666
02:08:51,168 --> 02:08:52,418
Naomi, look at me.

1667
02:08:53,085 --> 02:08:54,085
That girl, she's smart.

1668
02:08:54,168 --> 02:08:55,210
But you are double smart.

1669
02:08:55,585 --> 02:08:56,376
Okay?

1670
02:08:56,626 --> 02:08:58,376
Don't allow her to turn you easily.

1671
02:08:58,543 --> 02:08:59,626
How are you fighting?

1672
02:08:59,918 --> 02:09:03,418
Sir, I am fighting as I have learnt.

1673
02:09:06,126 --> 02:09:08,251
<i>The third and final round has started.</i>

1674
02:09:10,376 --> 02:09:11,793
<i>It's interesting to see,</i>

1675
02:09:11,876 --> 02:09:15,168
<i>that Naomi is now
playing cautiously.</i>

1676
02:09:34,251 --> 02:09:36,126
<i>Naomi trying real hard.</i>

1677
02:09:36,335 --> 02:09:38,460
<i>But Geeta holding her back.</i>

1678
02:09:39,085 --> 02:09:40,835
<i>It's a lock position again.</i>

1679
02:09:48,168 --> 02:09:49,376
<i>Naomi attacks again.</i>

1680
02:09:49,876 --> 02:09:51,501
<i>Geeta holds her back.</i>

1681
02:09:54,168 --> 02:09:56,085
<i>Will Naomi score?</i>

1682
02:09:57,335 --> 02:09:59,376
Hold on, Geeta!

1683
02:10:05,335 --> 02:10:07,960
<i>The score stands at O-O.</i>

1684
02:10:08,376 --> 02:10:10,085
<i>Naomi tries harder.</i>

1685
02:10:13,001 --> 02:10:15,793
<i>Geeta is exposed here
but holds her back.</i>

1686
02:10:30,751 --> 02:10:33,085
<i>Geeta hanging on
by the skin of her teeth.</i>

1687
02:10:33,210 --> 02:10:35,626
<i>Only 12 seconds left.</i>

1688
02:10:36,418 --> 02:10:38,543
<i>The score still O-O.</i>

1689
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:41,668
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1690
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:53,043
<i>With that this round is tied at O-O.</i>

1691
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:55,210
She could have scored.

1692
02:10:55,710 --> 02:10:56,960
Now there'll be a toss.

1693
02:10:57,376 --> 02:10:59,543
<i>Now there will be a toss.</i>

1694
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:02,335
<i>This is known as a 'clinch'.</i>

1695
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:06,918
<i>The wrestler who wins the toss
gets to choose a grip,</i>

1696
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:10,626
<i>and gets 30 seconds to score.</i>

1697
02:11:11,376 --> 02:11:14,126
<i>If the red side falls up,
Naomi gets to attack,</i>

1698
02:11:14,501 --> 02:11:17,085
<i>if it's blue, Geeta gets to attack.</i>

1699
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:20,001
<i>In 99 percent of the cases
the one who wins the toss,</i>

1700
02:11:20,085 --> 02:11:21,543
<i>wins the match.</i>

1701
02:11:34,501 --> 02:11:35,793
<i>Oh!</i>

1702
02:11:35,876 --> 02:11:39,251
<i>Maybe even destiny
doesn't want Geeta to win.</i>

1703
02:11:40,793 --> 02:11:44,293
<i>It's next to impossible to defend
against Naomi for 30 seconds.</i>

1704
02:11:46,501 --> 02:11:48,168
<i>Which leg do you choose?
- Right.</i>

1705
02:11:48,376 --> 02:11:51,085
<i>Naomi has chosen
Geeta's right leg.</i>

1706
02:11:51,751 --> 02:11:54,043
<i>Geeta takes a defensive position.</i>

1707
02:11:55,168 --> 02:11:57,543
<i>Naomi takes her grip of choice.</i>

1708
02:11:58,543 --> 02:12:00,085
<i>Now, Geeta has two options.</i>

1709
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,043
<i>Not allow Naomi to score
for 30 seconds,</i>

1710
02:12:03,126 --> 02:12:05,460
<i>or score herself,
and win the match.</i>

1711
02:12:06,585 --> 02:12:10,960
<i>In this position against Naomi,
both are almost impossible.</i>

1712
02:12:27,126 --> 02:12:29,543
<i>She lifts Geeta!</i>

1713
02:12:33,793 --> 02:12:36,751
<i>And Geeta scores a point!</i>

1714
02:12:42,043 --> 02:12:45,543
<i>No one expected
Geeta to win this match.</i>

1715
02:12:46,376 --> 02:12:50,960
<i>She has beaten the number one
contender for gold,</i>

1716
02:12:51,043 --> 02:12:54,168
<i>in this very exciting clinch,</i>

1717
02:12:54,251 --> 02:12:57,210
<i>and entered the finals!</i>

1718
02:12:58,085 --> 02:13:01,001
<i>And let's hope that
Geeta Phogat,</i>

1719
02:13:01,293 --> 02:13:04,710
<i>maintains her wonderful form
in the finals too.</i>

1720
02:13:24,418 --> 02:13:25,918
Shall we go, uncle?

1721
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:27,876
Let's see the next match.

1722
02:13:28,251 --> 02:13:30,876
Let's find out whether Geeta's finals
is against the Australian,

1723
02:13:31,085 --> 02:13:32,293
or the Scottish wrestler.

1724
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,626
I'm very proud of Geeta.

1725
02:13:35,168 --> 02:13:38,126
She followed my strategy to the T.

1726
02:13:38,543 --> 02:13:40,293
The result is in front of you.

1727
02:13:41,251 --> 02:13:42,668
Here she comes.

1728
02:13:44,876 --> 02:13:46,543
She looks good.

1729
02:13:47,876 --> 02:13:49,501
I mean... as a wrestler.

1730
02:13:51,376 --> 02:13:54,710
Uncle, isn't she the
same one from the DVD?

1731
02:13:56,543 --> 02:13:58,001
Angelina Watson.

1732
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:00,418
She's defeated Geeta twice.

1733
02:14:02,210 --> 02:14:04,293
She's played well till now.

1734
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,710
And she'll play well
in the finals too.

1735
02:14:11,835 --> 02:14:14,876
I've always had faith in Geeta.

1736
02:14:15,335 --> 02:14:18,793
Sooner or later she had to
win an international medal.

1737
02:14:23,751 --> 02:14:25,543
A silver is guaranteed now!

1738
02:14:32,043 --> 02:14:33,585
The final won't be so easy.

1739
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:35,335
Geeta-ji,

1740
02:14:35,835 --> 02:14:37,626
your game has changed dramatically.

1741
02:14:37,835 --> 02:14:39,126
How did this happen?

1742
02:14:44,376 --> 02:14:47,418
The entire credit for this,

1743
02:14:47,626 --> 02:14:49,085
goes to my father.

1744
02:14:52,668 --> 02:14:55,376
He never stopped believing in me.

1745
02:15:04,918 --> 02:15:05,793
Mahavir-ji!

1746
02:15:06,793 --> 02:15:08,293
Hello, Mr. Shamim.

1747
02:15:08,418 --> 02:15:10,085
Congratulations, Mahavir-ji!

1748
02:15:10,168 --> 02:15:11,751
Geeta fought very well.

1749
02:15:11,876 --> 02:15:14,418
All of Balali is proud.

1750
02:15:14,626 --> 02:15:15,960
And these girls insisted,

1751
02:15:16,085 --> 02:15:18,293
on watching Geeta's match
in the stadium,

1752
02:15:18,376 --> 02:15:19,585
or they won't eat.

1753
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:23,001
How did you like the match?

1754
02:15:23,085 --> 02:15:24,293
Loved it!

1755
02:15:24,376 --> 02:15:26,460
Give this to her.

1756
02:15:27,876 --> 02:15:28,668
What is this?

1757
02:15:28,835 --> 02:15:29,918
I prayed for her.

1758
02:15:30,043 --> 02:15:31,793
Tomorrow is the final.

1759
02:15:34,918 --> 02:15:35,710
Bless you!

1760
02:15:36,126 --> 02:15:37,751
How can we allow this, sir?

1761
02:15:38,168 --> 02:15:40,835
Mahavir Singh is shouting instructions
to Geeta from the audience.

1762
02:15:41,085 --> 02:15:43,751
The poor thing is getting confused
whether to listen to him or me.

1763
02:15:45,835 --> 02:15:49,085
From her game, it sure doesn't
seem like she's confused.

1764
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:54,335
Besides, how can we ask
the audience to remain silent?

1765
02:15:55,335 --> 02:15:56,376
Aren't you the coach?

1766
02:15:57,876 --> 02:15:59,418
She should be listening to you.

1767
02:15:59,710 --> 02:16:01,751
No, sir... she is listening to me.

1768
02:16:02,418 --> 02:16:04,751
That's why she's winning.
- Then what's the problem?

1769
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:08,918
You wanted a bronze, right?

1770
02:16:10,418 --> 02:16:13,460
It's quite possible that
tomorrow she may win gold.

1771
02:16:14,543 --> 02:16:15,335
No?

1772
02:16:17,376 --> 02:16:21,710
I'm surprised she's made it so far
but I am happy for her.

1773
02:16:22,001 --> 02:16:24,543
It should be an interesting
final tomorrow.

1774
02:16:24,626 --> 02:16:27,668
Playing an Indian
in front of an Indian crowd.

1775
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,668
Beating her, of course!

1776
02:16:29,793 --> 02:16:32,335
Angelina, any pressure
before the finals?

1777
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:36,210
Yeah, I'm sure she must be
under tremendous pressure.

1778
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:38,626
I've beaten her twice.

1779
02:16:38,918 --> 02:16:40,085
First round?
- Yeah.

1780
02:16:40,168 --> 02:16:41,668
Yeah, first round.

1781
02:16:42,335 --> 02:16:44,251
So, thank you and,

1782
02:16:44,335 --> 02:16:45,460
Namaste!

1783
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:53,418
What's the strategy
for tomorrow, papa?

1784
02:17:01,418 --> 02:17:04,335
There is only one strategy
for tomorrow, child.

1785
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:09,293
You have to fight in a way
that people remember you.

1786
02:17:12,501 --> 02:17:14,251
If you win silver,

1787
02:17:14,835 --> 02:17:17,460
sooner or later
you'll be forgotten.

1788
02:17:19,335 --> 02:17:23,293
If you win gold,
you will become an example.

1789
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:28,835
And examples are given, child...
not forgotten.

1790
02:17:34,085 --> 02:17:36,168
See those girls?

1791
02:17:38,126 --> 02:17:40,668
If you win tomorrow,
you will not win alone.

1792
02:17:41,418 --> 02:17:45,126
Millions of girls like them
will win along with you.

1793
02:17:47,668 --> 02:17:51,960
It'll be a victory for every girl who
is considered inferior to boys;

1794
02:17:52,501 --> 02:17:55,043
who is forced
into household chores,

1795
02:17:55,126 --> 02:17:58,043
who is married off
to just raise children.

1796
02:18:00,668 --> 02:18:04,335
Tomorrow's match is
the most important one.

1797
02:18:07,001 --> 02:18:10,168
Because tomorrow you won't be
fighting just that Australian

1798
02:18:10,543 --> 02:18:15,085
but all those people
who think less of girls.

1799
02:18:22,918 --> 02:18:25,668
<i>The finals of the women's wrestling,
Commonwealth Games 2010,</i>

1800
02:18:25,918 --> 02:18:28,751
<i>55-kilo category, is about to begin.</i>

1801
02:18:29,085 --> 02:18:33,793
<i>India's Geeta Kumari versus
Australia's Angelina Watson.</i>

1802
02:18:34,876 --> 02:18:37,293
<i>We'd like to remind you all,</i>

1803
02:18:37,376 --> 02:18:40,918
<i>that never before has
an Indian female wrestler,</i>

1804
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:44,460
<i>ever won gold in the
Commonwealth Games.</i>

1805
02:18:45,251 --> 02:18:47,460
<i>In this crowd, we see,</i>

1806
02:18:48,085 --> 02:18:51,668
<i>a lot of hope, enthusiasm
and the Indian flag.</i>

1807
02:19:09,043 --> 02:19:10,376
Hello, sir!

1808
02:19:10,460 --> 02:19:12,043
Aren't you Mahavir Singh-ji?

1809
02:19:12,126 --> 02:19:13,543
Geeta's father?
- Yes.

1810
02:19:13,626 --> 02:19:14,585
A moment please.

1811
02:19:14,835 --> 02:19:18,376
The chairman of the Wrestling
Federation wants to meet you.

1812
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:19,835
Some important matter.

1813
02:19:20,626 --> 02:19:23,126
I'll meet him later.
It's my daughter's match.

1814
02:19:23,251 --> 02:19:25,460
He's a big man.
He might get offended.

1815
02:19:25,543 --> 02:19:27,835
Just two minutes.

1816
02:19:31,335 --> 02:19:32,668
You carry on. I'll be there.

1817
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:41,168
"The entire credit for this
goes to my father."

1818
02:19:42,043 --> 02:19:43,960
Go... take the credit.

1819
02:19:54,668 --> 02:19:55,960
How much further is it?

1820
02:19:56,043 --> 02:19:57,460
We are almost there, sir.

1821
02:20:05,043 --> 02:20:06,668
Where have you got me?

1822
02:20:08,126 --> 02:20:10,210
Hey, brother!

1823
02:20:10,501 --> 02:20:12,793
What are you doing, brother?

1824
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:19,460
<i>A thunderous applause for Geeta
as she walks in.</i>

1825
02:20:20,293 --> 02:20:21,835
Is anyone there?

1826
02:20:24,376 --> 02:20:25,543
Hello!

1827
02:20:26,293 --> 02:20:27,876
Anyone there?

1828
02:20:28,543 --> 02:20:30,001
This is the final.

1829
02:20:30,251 --> 02:20:31,585
Play carefully.

1830
02:21:02,210 --> 02:21:06,043
<i>Angelina Watson enters the stadium.</i>

1831
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:20,585
<i>And the final match begins.</i>

1832
02:21:20,668 --> 02:21:22,418
Go for gold, Geeta!

1833
02:21:28,626 --> 02:21:31,876
<i>Angelina, aggressive
from the start.</i>

1834
02:21:32,626 --> 02:21:34,210
<i>She attacks.</i>

1835
02:21:38,126 --> 02:21:39,210
<i>Geeta defends.</i>

1836
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:46,085
<i>And 3 points for Geeta!</i>

1837
02:21:46,293 --> 02:21:49,543
<i>Geeta takes a big lead
right from the start.</i>

1838
02:21:50,085 --> 02:21:52,918
<i>Geeta - 3; Angelina - O.</i>

1839
02:21:53,543 --> 02:21:54,335
Good... good!

1840
02:22:09,876 --> 02:22:11,626
<i>Another point for Geeta.</i>

1841
02:22:12,876 --> 02:22:16,210
<i>Geeta - 4; Angelina - O.</i>

1842
02:22:16,751 --> 02:22:19,085
<i>Geeta playing very well.</i>

1843
02:22:26,376 --> 02:22:28,210
<i>Angelina will need to act fast.</i>

1844
02:22:38,168 --> 02:22:40,043
<i>1 point to Angelina.</i>

1845
02:22:41,418 --> 02:22:43,960
<i>Angelina looks for a takedown.</i>

1846
02:22:46,168 --> 02:22:47,876
<i>Geeta defends well.</i>

1847
02:22:48,335 --> 02:22:49,751
<i>Referee whistles.</i>

1848
02:22:49,876 --> 02:22:52,668
<i>Geeta leads, 4-1.</i>

1849
02:22:58,126 --> 02:23:02,543
<i>1 point to Geeta.
Geeta- 5; Angelina -1.</i>

1850
02:23:03,043 --> 02:23:06,751
<i>And with this, Geeta Kumari
wins the first round quite easily.</i>

1851
02:23:06,835 --> 02:23:09,293
<i>Perhaps Angelina is realizing,</i>

1852
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:11,210
<i>that this is not the same Geeta,</i>

1853
02:23:11,293 --> 02:23:13,543
<i>whom she had defeated
easily in the past.</i>

1854
02:23:43,251 --> 02:23:45,085
<i>And the second round starts.</i>

1855
02:23:45,251 --> 02:23:48,043
<i>Will Geeta win this round
and create history?</i>

1856
02:23:52,751 --> 02:23:54,668
<i>An excellent takedown!
1 point to Geeta.</i>

1857
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,085
<i>Geeta - 1; Angelina - O.</i>

1858
02:23:59,793 --> 02:24:01,501
Go... Geeta, go!

1859
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:12,210
<i>2 more points for Geeta!</i>

1860
02:24:12,293 --> 02:24:15,251
<i>Geeta - 3; Angelina - O.</i>

1861
02:24:15,335 --> 02:24:18,293
<i>Geeta bearing down on Angelina.</i>

1862
02:24:22,460 --> 02:24:24,001
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1863
02:24:24,793 --> 02:24:26,710
<i>1 point for Geeta.</i>

1864
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:28,793
<i>Two more points,</i>

1865
02:24:28,876 --> 02:24:30,835
<i>and she'll win this round
by technical superiority,</i>

1866
02:24:30,918 --> 02:24:32,501
<i>and the championship!</i>

1867
02:24:33,126 --> 02:24:35,293
<i>Geeta bearing down
with all her might.</i>

1868
02:24:35,543 --> 02:24:37,418
<i>Will Geeta win?</i>

1869
02:24:39,043 --> 02:24:41,376
<i>The referee's whistle saves Angelina!</i>

1870
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:43,043
No problem... Geeta!

1871
02:24:47,751 --> 02:24:49,710
<i>Angelina seems furious.</i>

1872
02:24:54,668 --> 02:24:58,418
<i>1 point for Angelina.
Angelina - 1; Geeta - 4.</i>

1873
02:24:58,501 --> 02:25:00,335
<i>Geeta is still in danger.</i>

1874
02:25:01,543 --> 02:25:03,376
<i>2 more points for Angelina.</i>

1875
02:25:04,501 --> 02:25:06,918
<i>Geeta - 4; Angelina - 3.</i>

1876
02:25:10,876 --> 02:25:12,460
No problem... come on!

1877
02:25:12,543 --> 02:25:14,918
<i>Geeta still leads by 1 point.</i>

1878
02:25:15,168 --> 02:25:17,960
<i>She needs to hold on to it
a little longer.</i>

1879
02:25:19,376 --> 02:25:21,543
<i>Will Geeta retain this lead?</i>

1880
02:25:23,876 --> 02:25:25,335
<i>Time is running out.</i>

1881
02:25:25,585 --> 02:25:27,085
<i>Geeta defends well.</i>

1882
02:25:27,376 --> 02:25:29,418
<i>Angelina going all out.</i>

1883
02:25:31,126 --> 02:25:33,126
<i>3 points to Angelina!</i>

1884
02:25:33,376 --> 02:25:36,001
<i>Angelina - 6; Geeta - 4.</i>

1885
02:25:40,751 --> 02:25:43,043
<i>And this round comes to an end.</i>

1886
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:49,126
<i>And Angelina has shown
what a true champion is made of!</i>

1887
02:25:49,835 --> 02:25:52,460
What are you doing?
You could've won the match!

1888
02:26:01,543 --> 02:26:04,210
<i>Angelina, with renewed enthusiasm.</i>

1889
02:26:06,501 --> 02:26:10,876
<i>It's not going to be
easy for Geeta.</i>

1890
02:26:11,376 --> 02:26:13,751
<i>Angelina aggressive
from the start.</i>

1891
02:26:21,168 --> 02:26:24,335
<i>3 points for Angelina!</i>

1892
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:28,251
<i>A 3-point lead in the final round!</i>

1893
02:26:29,543 --> 02:26:32,460
<i>Angelina - 3; Geeta - O.</i>

1894
02:26:44,543 --> 02:26:46,710
<i>1 point more to Angelina.</i>

1895
02:26:47,335 --> 02:26:50,376
<i>Angelina - 4; Geeta - O.</i>

1896
02:26:50,835 --> 02:26:54,668
<i>And this match leaning
in favor of Angelina.</i>

1897
02:26:54,960 --> 02:27:00,293
<i>If Geeta has to get back,
she needs to score fast.</i>

1898
02:27:06,376 --> 02:27:08,335
<i>A clever move by Geeta.</i>

1899
02:27:11,085 --> 02:27:13,376
<i>1 point to Geeta!</i>

1900
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:18,835
<i>Angelina - 4; Geeta - 1.</i>

1901
02:27:19,460 --> 02:27:21,418
<i>Time... running out.</i>

1902
02:27:21,668 --> 02:27:23,751
<i>Geeta needs to keep at it.</i>

1903
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:26,793
<i>But carefully, because if
Angelina scores again,</i>

1904
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:29,376
<i>it'll be impossible
to make a come back.</i>

1905
02:27:35,418 --> 02:27:36,418
<i>Geeta attacks,</i>

1906
02:27:36,501 --> 02:27:38,585
<i>but Angelina scores a point!</i>

1907
02:27:40,626 --> 02:27:43,543
<i>Angelina - 5; Geeta - 1.</i>

1908
02:27:45,043 --> 02:27:50,710
<i>It's almost impossible now
for Geeta to make a comeback!</i>

1909
02:27:59,876 --> 02:28:02,001
"Remember!"

1910
02:28:03,543 --> 02:28:06,501
"Your papa won't be there
to save you every time."

1911
02:28:07,168 --> 02:28:08,960
"I can only teach you to fight."

1912
02:28:09,085 --> 02:28:10,585
"But you have to fight yourself."

1913
02:28:10,751 --> 02:28:13,168
"Make the effort...
save yourself."

1914
02:28:20,168 --> 02:28:22,293
<i>Only 22 seconds left.</i>

1915
02:28:23,001 --> 02:28:26,293
<i>And Geeta is trailing by 4 points.</i>

1916
02:28:27,293 --> 02:28:35,085
<i>At this level, it's almost impossible
to cover this lead in such short time.</i>

1917
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:49,835
"To score five points is difficult,

1918
02:28:51,293 --> 02:28:53,126
but it can be done."

1919
02:28:55,293 --> 02:28:57,168
<i>Geeta trying.</i>

1920
02:28:57,501 --> 02:28:59,460
<i>But Angelina stalling for time.</i>

1921
02:29:02,668 --> 02:29:05,376
<i>Just a few seconds left.</i>

1922
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:09,960
<i>And India might have to
settle for a silver.</i>

1923
02:29:34,626 --> 02:29:37,293
"You have to play with
the opponent's mind."

1924
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:41,710
"Fake a move,

1925
02:29:41,793 --> 02:29:43,085
but make another."

1926
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:53,293
<i>And a fantastic move by Geeta.</i>

1927
02:29:55,418 --> 02:29:58,126
<i>Will time be on her side?</i>

1928
02:30:38,501 --> 02:30:40,460
<i>It's a gold for Geeta!</i>

1929
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:49,126
<i>Geeta has achieved
the impossible!</i>

1930
02:30:49,543 --> 02:30:52,126
<i>She is the first ever
female Indian wrestler,</i>

1931
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:54,835
<i>to win gold at the
Commonwealth Games!</i>

1932
02:30:56,126 --> 02:30:59,876
<i>Who would have thought that
a girl from a small village in India,</i>

1933
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:03,585
<i>is capable of leaving her mark
on the whole world!</i>

1934
02:31:05,168 --> 02:31:06,126
<i>Well done, Geeta!</i>

1935
02:31:06,835 --> 02:31:09,751
<i>A proud moment for India indeed!</i>

1936
02:31:55,418 --> 02:31:56,626
Champion!

1937
02:31:56,751 --> 02:31:57,960
Where's papa?

1938
02:31:58,668 --> 02:31:59,626
I don't know.

1939
02:31:59,710 --> 02:32:01,126
We came together though.

1940
02:32:14,626 --> 02:32:16,418
<i>And now the gold medal,</i>

1941
02:32:16,751 --> 02:32:19,585
<i>for India's Geeta Kumari Phogat.</i>

1942
02:32:25,168 --> 02:32:27,376
<i>And now, as per tradition,</i>

1943
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:31,335
<i>the national anthem of the
winning country will play.</i>

1944
02:33:33,001 --> 02:33:36,210
Victory to India!

1945
02:33:41,876 --> 02:33:43,793
Hey! What are you doing here?

1946
02:34:07,751 --> 02:34:11,168
Geeta, come...
the media is waiting.

1947
02:34:11,668 --> 02:34:12,501
Come.

1948
02:34:14,126 --> 02:34:15,668
Come. Everyone is waiting.

1949
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:18,960
Come... come.

1950
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:24,210
<i>And finally uncle uttered
those golden words,</i>

1951
02:35:24,543 --> 02:35:29,001
<i>that we had been pining to hear
for the past 10 years.</i>

1952
02:35:31,043 --> 02:35:32,876
I'm proud of you!
