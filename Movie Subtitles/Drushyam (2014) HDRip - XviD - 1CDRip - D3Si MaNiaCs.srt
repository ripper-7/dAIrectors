<i>Drushyam</i>

00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:38,375
"The world has changed..
Times have changed.."

3
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:42,750
"The world has changed..
Times have changed.."

4
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:47,000
"I am with you in
happiness and in sorrow."

5
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,875
"I am with you in happiness and in sorrow."
Ticket! Ticket! Ticket!

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,708
"The world has changed.. Times have changed.."
Ticket! Ticket!

7
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,083
Two tickets.
- Don't you have change?

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,625
Everybody is carrying
notes of higher denomination.

9
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,541
I'm writing behind the ticket.

10
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,708
Take back the change
while getting off the bus.

11
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,375
Okay? Here you go.

12
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,458
Ticket! Ticket! Have you
taken the ticket? Ticket!

13
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:12,958
Ticket! Ticket!
Ticket!

14
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:15,958
Hello.

15
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,416
Yes. I'm still in the bus.

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,791
Okay. All right. I'll call
you when I get off the bus.

17
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,625
How far is Rajavaram from here?

18
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,958
It's the next stop.

19
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,250
Are you new to this place?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,416
Yes, I'm a constable.

21
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,291
I got transferred to
Rajavaram Police Station.

22
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,333
Are you a policeman?

23
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,416
Actually, the new police station
was built recently.

24
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,166
That's Rajavaram
Police Station.

25
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,333
Who is it?

26
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,125
I'm the constable who got transferred here.
I'll be reporting from today.

27
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,083
Where did you work before?
- Kothavalasa.

28
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,583
Isn't the
sub-inspector here yet?

29
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,875
He'll come in an hour. Be seated.
- Okay.

30
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,416
Hello.
Rajavaram Police Station.

31
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,333
The sub-inspector
has not come yet, sir.

32
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,458
He has gone for a meeting
with the RDO.

33
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,041
I'll let him know when he comes.

34
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,375
Okay, sir.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,791
Have you come alone?
Don't you have a family?

36
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,083
Isn't he Rambabu?

37
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,208
Yes, yes. That's him.

38
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,875
He looks so innocent.
- He's not that innocent.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,791
All the officers got transferred
because of him.

40
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,666
What about his case?
- It won't be solved that easily.

41
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,666
It's not an ordinary case.

42
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,958
I think Jagdish paid
a hundred bucks extra.

43
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,833
No problem.
I'll add it to my account.

44
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,291
Mr. Rambabu,
today's collection..

45
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,500
Mr. Rambabu!
What is it?

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,791
Hey.
- The cars are so fast, sir.

47
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,083
Come on, hit him.

48
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,500
Wow!
- That was amazing, sir.

49
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,750
That was a good chase, wasn't it?
- No. The direction is bad.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,208
He should have taken close shots
of the hero driving the car.

51
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,625
Only then will the audience
be thrilled to watch.

52
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,875
You seem to be really excited,
sir.

53
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,500
Shall I say something serious?
- Yes, tell me.

54
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,958
Why don't you direct a movie, sir?

55
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,916
How about it?

56
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,708
Give me today's collection.
- I have it with me.

57
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,375
Okay.

58
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,416
What is this?
- What to do, sir?

59
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,500
Constable Veerabhadram
made me wait for a month

60
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,416
and didn't pay after that as well.
- What about Ms. Bhagyam's bill?

61
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,625
She watches only one show called 'Abala Avesham'
and so she paid only 20 bucks.

62
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,125
Then give her the cable connection
only during the show time.

63
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,666
No, sir. Let's cut the cable
connection exactly during the show time.

64
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,083
That way she will pay us
but not get to watch the show.

65
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,000
Isn't that a great idea?
- Is it?

66
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,375
It's not that great, sir.

67
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,541
Sir, it's a complaint call.
Let me handle it.

68
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,750
I don't want anybody calling to say

69
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,125
that they don't have a
cable connection, okay?

70
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,500
You don't want the phone
to ring, right? I'll handle it.

71
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,541
So there won't be any cable
connection problems henceforth?

72
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,750
That won't be necessary.

73
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,500
I'll just disconnect the phone.

74
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,958
This is a better solution.

75
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,583
Isn't that a great idea?

76
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,750
Right. Put the phone down.
Come on.

77
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,416
Go now.

78
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,875
Raghu, where have you been?

79
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,750
Sir, I have been out to get milk.
- Okay.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,291
Raghu, one special tea for me.

81
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,750
Sir,
have the police finished eating?

82
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,333
Yes, everybody did,
except that courageous officer.

83
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,416
Are you talking about Veerabhadram?
He's a sly fellow.

84
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,708
They don't know about him

85
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,250
and so they've been waiting
for him since morning.

86
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,208
For what? - They are from
the Lotheru village.

87
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,666
They just have a son who bought seeds by
taking a loan from a finance company.

88
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,583
He paid the interest
in regular installments.

89
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,250
This time, we suffered a
bad year due to heavy rains.

90
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,333
Constable Veerabhadram

91
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,708
took away my son for not paying
the interest since the last two months.

92
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,208
He wants us to pay the principal
amount and the interest together.

93
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,291
What do we do now?

94
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,916
How is Veerabhadram
related to this?

95
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,458
Veerabhadram must have been
bribed by the finance company.

96
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,250
You can go and talk to the
sub-inspector. - No, we can't.

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,833
Mr. Veerabhadram said
he would kill our son

98
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,333
if we spoke to
the sub-inspector.

99
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,208
Do something, Rambabu.

100
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,250
It's better that they
drag this case to court.

101
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,500
What's the use of that?

102
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,333
The finance company is getting

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,125
all the work done
by Veerabhadram.

104
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,333
There is no evidence to show
that he took away their son.

105
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,083
How can the court take a decision
without any evidence, Rambabu?

106
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,125
<i>Your Honor,
I'm ready to fight this case</i>

107
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,791
<i>on her behalf, if she permits.</i>

108
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,166
<i>I feel that the truth
she is fighting for</i>

109
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:22,125
<i>has been covered up
by the police</i>

110
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,375
<i>and so I request the court
to issue a search warrant.</i>

111
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,541
<i>Since it's a unique case,
the city's High Court</i>

112
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,541
<i>issued a habeas corpus petition
against G Sathyam.</i>

113
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,416
<i>The court has
ordered the police</i>

114
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,041
<i>to present Sathyam before
the court in 24 hours.</i>

115
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,791
What is a habeas corpus, sir?

116
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,208
I have an idea.

117
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,750
There's a lawyer in Vizag
named Vishwanath.

118
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,250
His assistant is from
this city itself.

119
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll talk to him and get
a habeas corpus issued

120
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,750
like it happens in 'Ankuram' film,
and get your son freed.

121
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,291
Will Veerabhadram allow this?

122
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,541
Nobody can do
anything about this.

123
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,250
When a habeas corpus is issued

124
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,375
the police will be forced
to present him before court.

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,916
In fact,
that won't be necessary.

126
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,375
It will be enough if we ask
the lawyer to call Veerabhadram

127
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,041
and warn him to release
their son or face

128
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,333
the habeas corpus petition.

129
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,791
Your son will be back home then.

130
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,875
Sir,
Mr. Veerabhadram is approaching.

131
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,000
Veerabhadram is coming.
Rambabu will manage.

132
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,916
Sit inside. - Yes, sir.
- Come on, come on. - Let's go.

133
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,458
Come on, move it.
Come on.

134
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,750
Raghu, bring two plates of 'idly'.

135
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,666
Sir, an old couple was
here. Have you seen them?

136
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,583
Nobody came here.
- Nobody came?

137
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,291
I wonder where they went.

138
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,541
Raghu, bring me two 'dosas'.
- You have to pay for it, sir.

139
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,375
Hey, have I ever paid?

140
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,083
We are not getting paid
because you're not paying us.

141
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,750
Nobody respects the cops
nowadays. Right, sir?

142
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,666
Nothing like that, sir.
The cops are all eating on credit.

143
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,625
Even we need money
to buy the groceries.

144
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,750
Are we the only ones living on credit?
Does Rambabu always pay?

145
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,375
Doesn't he live on credit?
- Of course, I do.

146
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,000
But I clear the
debts every week.

147
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,666
Then I'll clear my debts right away.
How much is it?

148
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,458
It's Rs. 4,500.
- Is that all?

149
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,125
I'll pay right away.

150
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,333
You can deduct the amount I owe you

151
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,958
from the commission that you owe me.
- What commission, sir?

152
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,541
A new police station has been
sanctioned to our district.

153
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,916
It will be built there,
opposite to your hotel.

154
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,583
Once the construction starts

155
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,250
I'll ask all the workers
to eat at your hotel.

156
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,125
What are you laughing at?

157
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,958
This is the only hotel here.
They don't have a choice.

158
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,208
I'll ask them not to eat.

159
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,125
Do you think they'll
go to the city to eat?

160
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,208
I have the capacity
to have another

161
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,750
hotel built here
immediately.

162
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,250
If you listen to Rambabu
and mess with the police

163
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,875
then your business and life will
be ruined like this. Remember that.

164
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,916
Veerabhadram.
- Why are you interfering in our job?

165
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,625
Raghu, one strong tea.

166
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,333
Rambabu, how are you?

167
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,083
I'm fine, sir.
The cops have been gracious.

168
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,416
The citizens don't need gratitude
from the cops, but security.

169
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,166
Sir, there's a new police station
coming up in front of your hotel.

170
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,416
You'll have great business.

171
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,875
We already spoke
about the business

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,041
and the commission
that has to be paid.

173
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,500
What commission are
you talking about?

174
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,333
You know about the commission,
don't you?

175
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,041
"The clouds in the sky.."

176
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,958
"Are pouring.."

177
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,416
Yes!

178
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,208
Sir, I designed an advertisement
for 'Guddu Sweet Stall'

179
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,583
and mentioned about the catering.
I want you to see it.

180
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,291
Sir.
- What is it?

181
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,958
Sir, come and see
the advertisement.

182
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,333
Hey, wait.
- What?

183
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,208
Oh, no! This is a tragic song.

184
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,666
Sir, you can watch this Shoban
Babu song tomorrow as well.

185
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,041
Come and see the advertisement,
Mr. Babu.

186
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,208
Okay, I'll come and see it.
- Wipe away your tears. - Okay.

187
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,208
Come, sir. Please come.
- Yes.

188
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,250
How can you be so sentimental?

189
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,791
Wipe away your
tears and see this.

190
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,625
Look at my talent.
How is it?

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,291
I think the phone number should
be mentioned in a larger font.

192
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,750
Sir, there is a voice over as well.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,208
People remember what they see,
more than what they hear.

194
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,041
The number has to be larger
for old people to be able to see.

195
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,500
Sir, old people are
never active at weddings.

196
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,125
Why would they call
to order sweets?

197
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,291
Go and answer the phone first.
- It must be a complaint call.

198
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,833
You're always expecting the worst.

199
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,625
We only get complaint calls,
don't we?

200
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,416
My wife might also call.
- Even she calls only to complain.

201
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,958
Shut up and answer the phone.
- All right.

202
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,750
If anybody asks for me, tell
them I'm not here. - Okay, okay.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,041
Hello. Jyothi Cable Network.
How may I help you?

204
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,166
Mr. Rambabu? Okay.
- You talk.

205
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,041
He's not here. Do you want me
to give him a message?

206
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,625
Okay, I'll tell him.
- Who was it?

207
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,583
It was Mr. Sharma.
- Was it a complaint?

208
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,000
It was not a complaint, but a request.
- A request?

209
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,250
He asked me not to cut the cable
connection

210
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,375
while the adult program was going on.

211
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,375
But he can't move
because of leprosy.

212
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,750
Sir, he can still enjoy
adult programs, can't he?

213
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,041
Hey!
- Yes.

214
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,375
Anju. - Yes.

215
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,291
Where's your mother?
- In the kitchen, dad.

216
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,916
Why have you woken up so early?
- I have exams starting today.

217
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,416
Okay, study.

218
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,208
You cook everyday but you still don't learn.

219
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,666
Why don't you
switch off the gas?

220
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,375
That was the second whistle.
There are still many left.

221
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,458
Don't act like you know everything.
- Okay, okay.

222
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,666
Have you kept the water
ready for my bath?

223
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,791
Everything is ready
in the washroom.

224
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,791
Will you come with me?
- Just shut up!

225
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,166
Don't start early
in the morning.

226
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,166
How about this evening then?
- Just go!

227
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,375
That's enough, mom.

228
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,416
You always forget to
switch off the lights.

229
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,041
The electricity
bill is always high.

230
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,291
Isn't our beauty
queen ready yet?

231
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,833
Anu! Anu!
- Coming, mom.

232
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,208
That's good.
- Look how she's trying to flatter dad.

233
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,583
It's not about that. This is her
way of expressing love to him.

234
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,458
Neither do you do it, nor do you
appreciate her doing it.

235
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,166
Was it raining near the cable
office last night? - No, why?

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,708
I called many times last night.

237
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,791
Your office telephone gets
disconnected during rains, right?

238
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,000
Dad, why don't you
buy a mobile phone?

239
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,125
There is never a stable network.
What's the use of a mobile phone?

240
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,666
You won't buy even if
there is a stable network.

241
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,250
By the way, you didn't
even ask why I called you up last night.

242
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,250
You would have called to ask me
to buy some groceries on your way home.

243
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,250
Don't taunt me. You just
don't care for any of us.

244
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,541
You just sit at office
and watch movies.

245
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,666
You have a wife and your children
waiting for you at home.

246
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,791
You don't even come home at
night.

247
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,708
You just don't care for us!

248
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,208
Sorry, dear. I do care for you.

249
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,541
Tell me why you called.
Tell me, dear.

250
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,833
We want to go to the city.
- For what? - Shopping.

251
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,708
S-Shopping? - Yes!

252
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,250
I have to buy clothes
for all of us.

253
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,458
What about the clothes
that you bought last year?

254
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,083
I have the clothes that we
bought during our wedding as well.

255
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,250
But I don't think tattered clothes
would look good.

256
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,791
This is why I asked you
to buy some loose clothes.

257
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,166
But you never listen to me.
- Even I asked you

258
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,416
to take me to a good store,
but you didn't listen to that.

259
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,250
You took us to a cheap store which
had a 'Buy One, Get One Free' offer.

260
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,208
I didn't take you to the store.
- It's you who took us to the store, dad.

261
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,333
Okay, we'll buy new clothes. One of my
customers owns a shop nearby. We can go there.

262
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,958
No!
We have to go to Vijayanagaram.

263
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,541
We want to eat 'biryani'

264
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,791
and watch a movie
in an air-conditioned theatre.

265
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,916
Mom, I want an ice-cream as well.
- What?

266
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,250
Yes. Ice-cream. There are a lot of
things that we want to purchase.

267
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,500
Do you have to spend so much now?
- Why are you so upset?

268
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,583
You're never home,
you don't understand our needs.

269
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,875
Even we desire a few things.

270
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,208
Look,
I don't roam around for fun.

271
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,208
It's my profession.
It's your duty to stay at home.

272
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,500
Family must mean the world to a
woman who is a wife and a mother.

273
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,166
She needs to accept it as a
responsibility and not a burden.

274
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,500
It's not enough to be beautiful.

275
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,916
You should also have
an understanding attitude.

276
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,625
You need to learn from Namrata.
- Who is Namrata?

277
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,958
Namrata Shirodkar.
She is Mahesh Babu's wife.

278
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,958
She got married when she was
at the peak of her career.

279
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,458
Though she was 'Miss India' once,
she now manages her family

280
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,458
like a good wife and mother.
You should learn from her.

281
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,208
Do you know what Namrata's
husband, Mahesh Babu, does?

282
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,000
What does he do?
- He earns crores of money.

283
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,958
He provides his wife with all the
facilities like a car, a driver etc.

284
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,166
He also takes them
abroad for shopping.

285
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,500
She's talking as though Mahesh Babu
takes her permission before doing anything.

286
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,750
Mom is telling the truth, dad.
I read it in the weekly magazine, 'Swati'.

287
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,041
Shut up!
Who ordered for that magazine?

288
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,416
Another thing. Do you know
how they went abroad? - How?

289
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,625
In the flight. - That's obvious. You can't
use an auto rickshaw to go abroad.

290
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,208
Your mother might
actually try that.

291
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,875
Dad, when will we travel by a flight?

292
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,500
Let's end this topic here.

293
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,916
Go to school now
and I'll take you shopping later.

294
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,083
Vijayanagaram.
- Okay, fine. Shopping.

295
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,708
Vijayanagaram. Shopping.
Vijayanagaram. Shopping.

296
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,041
Eat now. Else the food will be wasted.

297
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,458
Why are you digging this pit?
- This is to prepare compost.

298
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,666
You should have hired
someone else to do it instead.

299
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,583
Nowadays, workers ask
for a lot of money to work.

300
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,500
Why don't you buy some fertilizers?

301
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:27,625
Only people like you can think of such things.
- We have to change with the changing times.

302
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,583
You don't know anything about this.

303
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:34,583
Fertilizers have chemicals which ruin
the crop. This is a safer option.

304
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,958
I thought you watch only movies.

305
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,500
Now I know you watch
agricultural programs as well.

306
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,958
It's not because of television,
but because I'm clever.

307
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,583
<i>I know a lot, and need to learn little.
- Hello! Hello!</i>

308
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,958
That's not the proverb. It is,
'I know a little, and need to learn a lot'.

309
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,708
Even I watch some movies.
I just wanted to help you.

310
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,791
I used my hard earned money
to buy this five acre plot

311
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,583
and worked on it day and night
to transform it from barren land

312
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,541
into this cozy little home for you.
- Come on. Not again.

313
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,625
The children and I have got bored
of listening to this story.

314
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,750
You flatter yourself a lot nowadays.
- It's not flattery.

315
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,625
I might be an orphan but I still have
my self-respect and confidence.

316
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,750
You don't understand that
and hence you taunt me.

317
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,041
You also spend all
my hard-earned money on shopping.

318
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,333
You always make an issue about shopping.

319
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm not spending money lavishly.

320
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,416
I only go shopping once or twice a year.

321
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,708
We wouldn't have had clothes if I didn't.

322
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,791
What are you so happy about?
- Come closer.

323
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,375
You said something about not having clothes.

324
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,750
I was imagining that and..
- Shut up! Aren't you ashamed at all?

325
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,750
It was a mistake to even talk to you.

326
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,291
Simhadri. - Yes, sir.
- Why has everybody gathered here?

327
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
They're constructing a new police station.
So, I'm checking where to place the antenna.

328
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,666
That will be eight months later.
Get back to work.

329
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,333
Hey, Simhadri. - Sanes Naidu, I'll manage.
I'm going to the office now.

330
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, okay. - All right.
- Who is that?

331
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,375
He is Sanes Naidu.
He's getting married.

332
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,333
I agreed to relay his wedding live
through our cable network.

333
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:28,250
We don't have the equipment for that.
- Sir, it doesn't matter.

334
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,541
I'll video shoot his wedding
and send the video cassettes.

335
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,958
You can play those cassettes.

336
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,208
People will know that it's not a live stream.

337
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,541
Sir, everybody will
attend his wedding.

338
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,958
Nobody would watch television.
Isn't that a great idea? Appreciate me.

339
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,958
Shut up and get on the bike.
We have a lot of work left. Such an idiot.

340
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,500
<i>The audience gave me more votes because of
the expression I give when I get slapped.</i>

341
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,041
<i>Actor Nagarjuna was hurt
because his expressions were better.</i>

342
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:56,958
<i>Do you think you're too good?
Dons like you are no match to me.</i>

343
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,375
<i>You're such an idiot!</i>

344
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,875
<i>Why are you slapping me?
You're just acting like a don.</i>

345
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,291
<i>Acting like a don?
- What?</i>

346
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,250
Sir, one strong tea. - Raghu,
bring one strong tea for the contractor.

347
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,250
Rambabu.

348
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,291
He is the contractor who is managing
the construction of the new police station.

349
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,875
You are..
- He is Rambabu.

350
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,541
He provides cable connection
to the residents of this area.

351
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,041
His office is on top of that building.

352
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,125
Rambabu, will you go home for dinner
or stay here?

353
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,583
I already informed Jyothi
that I wouldn't be home for dinner.

354
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,416
I'll sleep in the office tonight.
- Why is that so?

355
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,958
Why do you sleep in the office
when you have a home here?

356
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,291
Rambabu loves movies and he can
watch movies at his office.

357
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,125
Don't you go home at night?
- There's a problem with the cable connection.

358
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,166
People don't pay the bill if they
don't have a cable connection.

359
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,000
So one person has to stay in the office
and take care of the work.

360
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,541
Yes, you're right.
- Okay. See you again.

361
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,166
Sir, I'll come here for dinner.
- Okay.

362
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:49,583
"I've gone berserk."

363
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,500
"I've gone berserk in your love."

364
00:19:55,083 --> 00:20:00,000
"I've gone berserk."

365
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,750
"I've gone berserk in your love."

366
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,041
"I long for you all day."

367
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,250
"I feel restless without you."

368
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,208
"My mind is not in place.."

369
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,083
"Without you."

370
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,875
Simhadri.
- Yes.

371
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,875
I'm going home. I have a headache.
- Okay, sir.

372
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:29,166
<i>He only looks cunning, but is very innocent.
He couldn't guess my true intentions.</i>

373
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,791
Sir, is the bedroom song over?
- What?

374
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,041
<i>He only looks innocent, but is very cunning.</i>

375
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,291
I just have a headache.

376
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,375
Didn't you find any medicine at the office?
- No. Move aside.

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,041
What did you watch today?
A bedroom scene or something else?

378
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,875
If you agree, it will be a romantic scene.
- And if I don't?

379
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,666
It will be an assault scene.
Move aside!

380
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,916
There you go.

381
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,791
Hey! Stop it.

382
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,250
You're behaving like a youngster
even at this age. - I'm not old, dear.

383
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,625
I am still a youngster.
- Is it? - Yes!

384
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,250
Shall I ask you something?
- Tell me, dear.

385
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,208
Let's sell the old jeep
and buy a Maruti.

386
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,416
All you women are very clever. You know
our weakness and take advantage of it.

387
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,875
I'm not like everybody else.

388
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,208
I can be in control.
No Maruti!

389
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,916
Don't try to act smart with me.

390
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,625
Okay fine. Let's buy a Maruti.

391
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,000
Come to me now.
- Okay.

392
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,708
Shall I ask you something?
- Tell me, dear.

393
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,750
Let's buy a second hand car.
- No need.

394
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:51,250
A new one will be very expensive.
- I'll now go out.

395
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,541
Come on, listen to me.
- I don't want to listen.

396
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,916
Okay, let's buy a new car. I watched
a romantic movie.

397
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,458
Try and understand my feelings.

398
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,416
How many times should I ask you
to switch off the lights?

399
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,708
The bill for electricity usage will be high.

400
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:14,375
I don't want it. - Dad,
did you come home last night?

401
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,375
What? I..

402
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,166
Why? Shouldn't he come home?

403
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,958
We're getting late for school everyday
because of you. Eat quickly.

404
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,125
Why are you scolding me?

405
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,791
Dad never comes home at night.

406
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,291
That's why I asked. Tell me, dad.

407
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,833
Why did you come home last night?

408
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,583
Actually, I came to tell you

409
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,958
that we're buying a new Maruti.

410
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,125
Yes. We're buying a new Maruti.

411
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,333
What? Really, dad?
- Yes, we're buying a Maruti.

412
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,250
Maruti is a bad choice, dad.
- Really?

413
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,125
Anu is a good girl.

414
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,708
Let's buy an Audi.
- Is that more reasonable?

415
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,458
Come on, dad.

416
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,625
It's worth forty lakhs.
- Forty lakhs? Is it made of gold?

417
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,541
That's why you need to read
the newspaper frequently.

418
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,791
I don't read the newspapers only because
I want to avoid reading about such atrocities.

419
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,541
For someone who watches
movies everyday

420
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,416
it's surprising that you
don't know about Audi cars.

421
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,500
I don't pay attention to objects
that are expensive.

422
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,208
That's why I don't know
about Bodi.

423
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,500
It's not 'Bodi', it's 'Audi'.
- Whatever it is.

424
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,791
We're buying a Maruti.

425
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,708
When are we buying it, dad?

426
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,333
Eat quickly.
You're getting late for school.

427
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,625
She'll leave soon. Take bath
and come. I'll serve breakfast.

428
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,250
I don't have the patience
to take bath.

429
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,916
How will you then dig the pit for compost
without patience?

430
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,583
I don't have the stamina to do that.

431
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,041
All my stamina got drained
last night.

432
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,625
What? I mean..

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,291
Actually..

434
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,833
I mean, my bike broke down
on the way home last night.

435
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,041
I pushed my bike all the way home
so I'm very tired. Yes.

436
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,375
Mom, I asked you
about the nature camp.

437
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,541
May I please attend the camp?
- I said, no.

438
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:47,458
Look what mom is saying, dad.
- What's the matter?

439
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,250
All of us are attending
a nature camp

440
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,375
to educate people

441
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,208
not to build commercial complexes
on fertile yield-giving land.

442
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,791
Fifty people were selected
from our state

443
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,875
out of which only two
were from our school.

444
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,958
Why don't you study at home instead
of attending the nature camp?

445
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,083
If you transform all the fields
into commercial complexes

446
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,416
your future generations will have to
live on medicines rather than food.

447
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,666
You may buy anything
with money

448
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,750
but you can never buy food that will
cure you of hunger. Understand one thing.

449
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:17,000
If the food remains in your body,
you'll become sick.

450
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,583
If children remain in school,
they'll become crazy.

451
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,500
<i>I walk on a unique path.</i>
- Super, dad!

452
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:23,916
That was amazing.
- Exactly.

453
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:27,750
Yes, that was amazing. Give her
Rs. 2000 and then she can go.

454
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,791
Rs. 2000? Rs. 2000!
- Dad.

455
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,458
Will this help you in any way?
- Yes.

456
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,791
We'll have to answer questions
about this in the exam.

457
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:38,916
I'm trying to score the first rank.
- Is the first rank confirmed?

458
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,458
Confirm!
- Okay then.

459
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:41,958
Haven't you left yet?
- Bye, dad.

460
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,083
You're late for school.
Come on. Go to school.

461
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,625
Have you packed all the books?

462
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,333
Rs. 2000!

463
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,958
How can you talk like that
in front of children?

464
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,666
Anju is a grown-up.
She understands everything.

465
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,541
No, I don't think she understands.

466
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,750
I couldn't understand anything
when I was her age.

467
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,791
You don't understand anything even now.
- What?

468
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:46,875
"Every day is a celebration"

469
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,750
"if you live it happily."

470
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:53,208
"Every day will be pleasant"

471
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,208
"if you wake up with a smile."

472
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:01,875
"And if you value the happiness
that you have."

473
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:07,833
"Every part of life seems sweet
and enjoyable."

474
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:15,166
"Every day of life will remain
as a fond memory."

475
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:18,208
"Every day is a celebration"

476
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,208
"if you live it happily."

477
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,875
"Every day will be pleasant"

478
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,958
"if you wake up with a smile."

479
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:51,458
"Life will be filled with joy
and happiness."

480
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,875
"It is said that you won't be sad
if you have dreams to fulfill."

481
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:01,541
"Include some fun in life"

482
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,750
"and accept some problems."

483
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:08,041
"Fill your life with fun and play."

484
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:13,541
"Ours is a family of parents and siblings
who live happily."

485
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:19,666
"Every part of life seems sweet
and enjoyable."

486
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:23,458
"Every day of life will remain
as a fond memory."

487
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,833
"Every day is a celebration
if you live it happily."

488
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,916
"Every day will be pleasant"

489
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,250
"if you wake up with a smile."

490
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:39,541
"Every day is spring,
if you bloom with joy."

491
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:59,958
"The friendship we share"

492
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:03,166
"is a blessing in disguise."

493
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:09,833
"The bond we share is not broken so easily."

494
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,333
"You won't have to visit religious places"

495
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:16,416
"to find some peace of mind."

496
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:19,583
"Find peace at home with family"

497
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,250
"amongst their pranks and tantrums."

498
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,333
"Every part of life seems sweet
and enjoyable."

499
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:38,541
"Every day of life will remain
as a fond memory."

500
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,583
"Every day is a celebration"

501
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,625
"if you live it happily."

502
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,333
"Every day will be pleasant"

503
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:51,208
"if you wake up with a smile."

504
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:56,916
"And if you value the happiness
that you have."

505
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:02,958
"Every part of life seems sweet
and enjoyable."

506
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:10,125
"Every day of life will remain
as a fond memory."

507
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:27,208
This is not necessary, mother-in-law.
- Why not, Rambabu? It makes us happy.

508
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,375
Rambabu

509
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:32,958
you understood our problems
and refused to accept dowry from us

510
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,750
during the wedding.
Now I want to give away the coconut farm

511
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,583
as a dowry for my grandchildren's wedding.

512
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,541
Father-in-law, you agreed
to get Jyothi married to me

513
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:44,958
though you knew I was an orphan.

514
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,750
Today, you're giving me property
without me asking for it.

515
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:51,666
Thank you very much.
Dowry is not a necessity, father-in-law.

516
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,166
Girls should be educated
and should possess good values.

517
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,291
We have enough.
I'll ask you if I need anything.

518
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,416
I think you're the most
well-mannered person, Rambabu.

519
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:06,666
Anju, you lost a pawn.
- Hi, uncle! - Hey, Anu.

520
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:09,291
How are you, sister?
- I'm fine. Where had you been?

521
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,250
We came a long time ago.
- I had gone out.

522
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,166
How are you, brother-in-law?
- It's been a long time, Rajesh.

523
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,666
He is always busy helping people solve
their problems

524
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,458
by fighting for their rights.

525
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,166
What are you fighting for this time?

526
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,750
There's a village named Devarapalli,
25 kilometers from here.

527
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:29,083
We got the stone grinding project closed
because of the heavy pollution.

528
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:33,666
I found these fish near the quarry.
They taste amazing.

529
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,500
Rambabu, fish is good for the heart.
- Is it so? - Yes.

530
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,541
My heart is already at risk
because of your shopping antics.

531
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,958
So it's better to eat fish.

532
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,875
Don't laugh. Give me the fish.
Let's go, mother.

533
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,791
Rambabu, coffee.
- Yes.

534
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,833
Rambabu. - Yes.
- Shall I say something? - What?

535
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:06,041
I don't know if you'll agree or not.
- Tell me. I'll think about it.

536
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:10,708
Here you go.
- What is it? - Read it.

537
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,458
<i>Family Preaching from the Divine</i>

538
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:17,291
<i>by Sri Sri Sri Sachidananda Maharishi</i>

539
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,416
<i>on, Saturday, the 2nd of August</i>

540
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:23,916
<i>from 8:00 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.</i>

541
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,208
We didn't attend it the last year.

542
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:30,458
His sermons are very valuable.
Shall we all go?

543
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:33,333
I can't come.
Go with the children if you want to.

544
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,125
This is for all the family members.

545
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,541
We can't go without you. Come with us.

546
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,541
I told you that I can't come.
- Dad, why is it a curfew today?

547
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,583
The curfew is to protest
the rise in fuel prices.

548
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:49,125
You're not buying the car
because of the rise in fuel prices?

549
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,416
We'll buy the car. Don't you trust me?
Right, Jyothi?

550
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:55,958
How is the rise in fuel prices
related to buying a new car?

551
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,208
Your dad will definitely buy a new car.

552
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,333
He just won't use it. Isn't it, dear?

553
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,333
Anju, you took money from me
and went to the nature camp.

554
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,500
You didn't tell me anything about it.

555
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:10,125
It was very effective, dad.
We attended the nature camp in the morning

556
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:14,291
and danced around the campfire at night.
- Good.

557
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,750
All of us enjoyed a lot.
We even clicked pictures.

558
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:23,333
That reminds me of something.
One of the girls created a scene

559
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,375
because some rich guy was clicking
pictures of girls on his mobile phone.

560
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,083
Did he click your pictures as well?
- He did.

561
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,958
Why did you get your picture clicked?
You should have refused.

562
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,416
I didn't get my picture clicked.
He clicked pictures without my permission.

563
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,291
Don't you read the newspaper?

564
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,958
Many girls are committing suicide
because of such issues.

565
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,666
Why would anybody commit suicide
for such issues, mom?

566
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:45,458
Don't we get pictures clicked
during weddings as well?

567
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,958
Those are normal cameras.

568
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,291
The pictures that are clicked
on mobile phones are very indecent.

569
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:55,708
Mom, the pictures are the same
in cameras or mobile phones.

570
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,750
It's just that they alter the pictures
on the computer. Say something, dad.

571
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:02,458
Mom thinks she's right. - That's why
she didn't complete her schooling.

572
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:07,750
Hello, I've studied much more than
you have. Remember that.

573
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,875
That's not the issue.
I passed my class and you failed.

574
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:21,083
The flooring is completely ruined.
Why did you leave it unattended for so long?

575
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,083
I couldn't find efficient workers
in the village.

576
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,458
I want to rent it out
if you help me improve it.

577
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,458
We're completing the flooring
in the station.

578
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,791
Only the sub-inspector's room is left.

579
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,958
I'll help you once the work there
is finished on Monday.

580
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,458
Okay. - Rambabu, I'll go now.
I have to be on the site.

581
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,708
Wait, I'll come with you.

582
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,500
Mr. Contractor!

583
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,166
Sir, how much do I owe you?

584
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:47,041
I must have taken
some money from you.

585
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,625
I wanted to repay all that money.

586
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,916
Why are you acting so innocent?

587
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:57,583
I know who's making you do all this.

588
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,750
Do you think I'll be scared just because
you might complain to the sub-inspector?

589
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,958
Even he has a share
in the money that you paid.

590
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,958
I'm warning you.
If you complain to the sub-inspector again

591
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:11,583
then I'll make sure
that your career is ruined. Be careful.

592
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:14,041
Veerabhadram,
we know about the sub-inspector.

593
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,541
We won't believe you if you say
he supports you in your cheap antics.

594
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,916
Why are you interfering?
- Stop me from interfering, if you can.

595
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,833
Come on, come on.
- How dare you!

596
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:24,500
How dare you talk like that!
- You're messing with the cops.

597
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,208
I don't care if you're a cop.
I've seen enough people like you.

598
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,666
Please calm down, sir. - Get lost.
- Rambabu, be in your limits.

599
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:34,666
You don't know what I can do.
I'll teach you a lesson someday.

600
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,333
Why are you fighting with him
for my sake, Rambabu?

601
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,708
He doesn't deserve to be a cop.
- Yes, Rambabu.

602
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,541
But still he is a cop.
We have to be careful.

603
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:49,250
Why, sir? Why should I fear
the cops when I'm not wrong?

604
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,666
I've never committed a crime
and will never do so.

605
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,958
Give it to me, sister. I'll hold it.

606
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,250
Do you want to impress mom?
Hey!

607
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,416
Hi!
Hi, Anju.

608
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,416
Hi.
- Do you stay nearby?

609
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:21,750
Didn't you recognize me?

610
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,583
Aren't you Varun?
- So you remember me. Thanks.

611
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:29,083
How come you're here?
- Actually, I came here for you.

612
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,041
Mom, I'm hungry. Give me something to eat.

613
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,833
Where is your sister?
Did you bring the groceries?

614
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,875
Sister is walking slowly.

615
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,208
Here you go.

616
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,375
Where is your sister?
- I don't know.

617
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,708
What do you mean? You said
she was walking slowly.

618
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:57,625
We came together till Mr. Gopal's
house. I walked faster after that.

619
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,666
Anju!

620
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:08,916
Anju!

621
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,666
Where could she have gone?

622
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:16,083
Mom, the groceries are in the room.

623
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,416
Anju!

624
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,000
Anju!

625
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,416
Anju!
- Yes, mom.

626
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,125
When did you come home?
I called you so many times.

627
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,416
Why didn't you respond?
I got so worried.

628
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,500
Maybe she's listening to songs, mom.

629
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,875
Okay, come out soon.
I'll keep the milk ready.

630
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:04,833
<i>Don't worry, Anju.
Nobody other than me has seen this.</i>

631
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,708
<i>I'll delete it if you don't like.</i>

632
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:09,625
<i>But you should do as I say.</i>

633
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,875
<i>I'll come to your backyard at 11:00 p.m.</i>

634
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,500
<i>Come there, okay?
- I won't come, Varun. Please.</i>

635
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,791
<i>Hey, why are you crying, Anju?</i>

636
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,625
<i>I haven't come here
to create a problem for you.</i>

637
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:28,166
<i>I could have uploaded this
on the internet, if I wanted to.</i>

638
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,458
<i>But I won't do it. Because I like you.</i>

639
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:36,833
<i>So tonight.. - I won't come, Varun.
Please. I won't come.</i>

640
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:40,625
<i>Okay! It's not my responsibility</i>

641
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:45,125
<i>if your family has a problem with
this video going viral on the internet.</i>

642
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,416
<i>If you inform at home
or refuse to come tonight..</i>

643
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,708
<i>Hey, no. You won't do that, will you?</i>

644
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:57,750
<i>Please spare me, Varun. Please.
Varun, please. - Okay.</i>

645
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,916
<i>We'll meet at the backyard tonight then.</i>

646
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,333
<i>See you. Bye!</i>

647
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:18,208
You're asleep so soon.
You didn't even drink the milk.

648
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:22,083
I have a headache.
I'll just sleep for some time.

649
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,916
You'll obviously have a headache
if you listen to loud music.

650
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:32,958
Shall I give you a tablet?
- No, mom. I'll just sleep for a while.

651
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,708
I'll be all right.

652
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,208
Okay, go to sleep.

653
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:44,708
Why don't you eat something?
It's quite late.

654
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,541
I think it will rain heavily.

655
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:06,041
I better leave from here.
Else, there will be a lot of complaints.

656
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:10,000
Sir. Mr. Rambabu.
- What is it?

657
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,541
Shall I go home?
- You always want to go home.

658
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,916
Do you have an umbrella?
- Yes.

659
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,833
Okay, go then.
- All right.

660
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,125
Did you tell your mother?

661
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,291
You have no idea
how problematic I can be.

662
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,958
Varun, please don't trouble me.
- I didn't want to trouble you.

663
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,666
But you cheated me.
- Varun.

664
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,375
Look, we hail from a middle-class family.

665
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:59,416
We've never hurt you at all.
Why are you troubling us?

666
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,750
I'm sure even you have sisters.

667
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,833
Please don't ruin my daughter's life.

668
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm not ruining your daughter's life,
but you are.

669
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,416
Look at this.

670
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:25,666
I'll upload this clip on the internet
because you interfered in our affairs.

671
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,791
No. Don't do this. Please.

672
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,083
Please don't do this.

673
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,166
We'll be forced to commit suicide.

674
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:38,583
Please don't.
- Okay, I won't.

675
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:43,541
I want your daughter to stay
with me for one hour instead.

676
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,458
I won't accept that in any case.

677
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:00,083
Mom!

678
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,041
Please, Varun. Give it to me.

679
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,083
Varun.

680
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,666
Anju!

681
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,958
Look, please don't do this.

682
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:20,375
Don't ruin my daughter's life.
I beg you.

683
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,125
She's just a child.

684
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,125
Don't ruin her life. Please don't.

685
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:35,208
Okay. I won't ruin Anju's life.
I'll delete the video.

686
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:40,375
Why don't you fulfill my wish instead?

687
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:11,333
Somebody walked in with dirty feet.
Jyothi! Jyothi!

688
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,125
Jyothi.

689
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:23,083
Dad! - Dad!

690
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,541
Hey, what happened?

691
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,208
Jyothi.

692
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,583
Tell me what happened.

693
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:49,166
<i>Why don't you fulfill my wish instead?</i>

694
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:30,500
<i>Listen. Varun? Varun?</i>

695
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,458
<i>Anju!
- What?</i>

696
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,708
<i>Varun. Varun.</i>

697
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,875
<i>Varun. Varun.</i>

698
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,041
<i>What happened?
- The phone is dead.</i>

699
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,083
<i>How do we inform dad now?</i>

700
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,166
<i>We can't wait till the morning.
Oh no.</i>

701
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,875
<i>Come, Anju.
- Okay.</i>

702
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,125
<i>Mom!</i>

703
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,000
<i>Anju, bring the spade quickly.
- Okay.</i>

704
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:14,375
<i>Anju, come on. Help me.</i>

705
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,625
Yes. Prabhakar here.

706
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:17,375
No, no. Nothing like that.

707
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,708
Let's start the board meeting
sharp at 12.

708
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,750
They are very prompt
and punctual unlike us.

709
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:26,375
I'll see you there. Okay?
See you. Bye.

710
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,708
<i>The number you're calling
is currently switched off.</i>

711
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,000
His phone is always switched off.

712
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:46,916
Where is Varun, Geetha? His phone
is switched off from yesterday.

713
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:49,541
Prabha, I've told you so many times.

714
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:53,083
Why do you keep calling him and disturb him?

715
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:55,708
He would have switched off his mobile
because of that.

716
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:58,958
He's not a child anymore.
We need to give him some freedom.

717
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:02,458
Else, he'll become a rebel.
- Geetha, I agree that you're right.

718
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,375
We should give him some freedom,
but there's a limit to that.

719
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,416
Varun has crossed all limits.

720
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:10,916
We have given him a car, laptop,
credit card, an internet connection

721
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:12,166
and everything else,
without him even asking for those.

722
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,416
Is this necessary at this age?

723
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,791
I think we're spoiling him.

724
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,583
Last month, his credit card bill
was Rs. 26,000.

725
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:25,000
He did some shopping last month.
He showed me the bills.

726
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:26,791
What's wrong with that?

727
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,291
You believe everything he says
and he takes advantage of that.

728
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:31,708
Why don't you understand?

729
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:37,291
Even I saw the bills. The bill was for
six pairs of jeans and two pairs of shoes.

730
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,791
But he had only two pairs of jeans
and one pair of shoes.

731
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,083
It was a fake bill, Geetha.

732
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,833
What did he do with the remaining money?

733
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,833
Geetha, he's doing something
wrong without telling us.

734
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:49,958
Did you check his room again?
- Yes.

735
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:53,958
That's why he didn't come home
last night.

736
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,625
Give him some privacy, Prabha.

737
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,833
Don't doubt him unnecessarily.

738
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,708
Children shouldn't expect privacy
from their parents, Geetha.

739
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,875
He would need privacy
if he's doing something in secret.

740
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:04,750
Why does he..
- Prabha, understand!

741
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:06,750
I can't convince you.

742
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,958
What do we do now?

743
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:29,708
I don't know.

744
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:32,958
I'm really scared.

745
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,791
I wasn't this scared even when I buried him.

746
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,916
I was so brave at that time.

747
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,458
Was it our mistake?

748
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,916
No.

749
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:50,375
You were right. - Why don't
we tell the cops about this?

750
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,708
He's the son of
the inspector general of police.

751
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:59,625
The cops won't spare us
if they come to know about this.

752
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,083
Anju's life will be ruined.

753
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,791
How do we get out of this problem?

754
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:14,875
Don't worry.
We never hurt anybody intentionally.

755
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:19,958
Though I'm an orphan, I faced all the
difficulties and took care of my family.

756
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:25,625
I'll protect our family even
if I have to sacrifice my life for it.

757
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:30,666
I won't let anything happen to you.
Don't lose hope. - Dad!

758
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,291
Dad!
- What is it?

759
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:37,166
The keys were in the room.
- I think these are his car keys.

760
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,666
So his car must be around.

761
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,041
How do we find his car?
- He has a yellow car, dad.

762
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,208
Let's go check if there is
something else in the room.

763
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:55,916
Where did the boy fall after he got hit?
- There.

764
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,625
What are you looking for?
- Blood stains.

765
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:09,541
Because there are no traces of blood,
I think he had an internal bleeding.

766
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,666
Clear out all this.
- Okay. - Come on.

767
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:21,416
Dad, SIM card.
- Wait.

768
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,833
<i>There has been a constant signal
from the same place.</i>

769
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,041
<i>We'll trace his SIM card
and nab the culprit.</i>

770
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,958
<i>He has changed the number.
- We need his phone number.</i>

771
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:33,583
<i>Sir, we can track them
through cell phone signals.</i>

772
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,875
<i>Phone signals will be connected
to different towers at different times.</i>

773
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,000
<i>Even if they leave the city, we can
track them using</i>

774
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,041
<i>the tower signals.</i>

775
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:53,541
<i>We can trace his movement
with the tower locations.</i>

776
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:02,250
Don't go out or call anybody
till I come back.

777
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,416
Nobody should find out
that you're at home.

778
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,708
Understood?
- Where are you going?

779
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:09,666
I have to find the car
and move it from there.

780
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:12,666
Come soon. We can't stay alone.

781
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,625
Don't worry. I'll be home by evening.

782
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:20,708
What happened?
- Dad, I'm scared that I may get arrested.

783
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,875
I won't let that happen.

784
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,750
No.

785
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,583
I promise you.

786
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:02,958
If someone had come
for passport enquiry

787
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,666
then he would have reported
that your son was not present at home.

788
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:07,958
So you need to be careful.
Don't count anymore.

789
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,708
Do you want to send your son abroad
by paying only Rs. 300?

790
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,375
Give me that amount as well

791
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,875
if you want your son to go abroad.

792
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:23,250
I had to make an offering at the temple.

793
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:25,291
It's the same if you give me.

794
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:28,291
Else, I'll report that your son
was not at home.

795
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,541
How much was the auto fare?

796
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:50,250
Wasn't that Rambabu?
- Maybe, sir.

797
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:59,291
Did he buy a new car recently?
- I don't know, sir.

798
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,250
<i>We didn't attend it the last year.</i>

799
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:50,583
<i>His sermons are very valuable.
Shall we all go?</i>

800
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,583
Hey, move the car.

801
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,041
How may I help you, sir?
- I need a mobile phone.

802
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,750
Which company, sir?
- A second hand phone will do.

803
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,000
Second hand phone?

804
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,458
I want a phone with full battery.
- Full battery..

805
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,166
Try this, sir.

806
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:50,291
How much is this worth?
- Rs. 900, sir.

807
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,250
Will you please insert this SIM card
in that phone? - Sure.

808
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,708
I'm going to Delhi by flight this evening.

809
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:08,500
The meeting will last
for two days, sir.

810
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:11,458
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

811
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,333
Sir, you have a call.

812
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:36,958
Please put the phone
on silent mode.

813
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:42,958
<i>The person you're calling seems
unavailable to take calls right now.</i>

814
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:29,416
<i>Alcohol consumption is injurious to health.</i>

815
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:35,833
<i>Alcohol consumption is injurious to health.</i>

816
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:09,916
<i>There's a village called Devarapalli,
25 kilometers from here.</i>

817
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:14,041
<i>We got the stone grinding project closed
because of the heavy pollution.</i>

818
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:54,833
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

819
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:59,375
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

820
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:06,208
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

821
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,041
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

822
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,166
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

823
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,291
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

824
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,833
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

825
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,500
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

826
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:39,333
<i>Smoking is injurious to health.</i>

827
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,875
Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Okay, sir.

828
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:00,625
You're here.
I thought you wouldn't come

829
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,208
and that I'd have to stay here tonight.

830
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:04,416
How about today's collection?

831
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,166
The collection is not that good
because of the rains.

832
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:12,375
I'm going out of station for two days.
You have to manage here. - Okay.

833
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:14,750
All right.

834
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,583
How come you're going out all of a sudden?

835
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:21,625
Vijayanagaram. Jyothi always wanted
to attend the preaching program.

836
01:03:21,791 --> 01:03:25,666
We decided to go now.
- Sir, is there some problem?

837
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,750
Why do you ask? - You look worried, sir.
I can see it in your face.

838
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:36,708
There's no problem now,
but there will be if you mess up here.

839
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,791
Now you're back to normal.
Carry on. I'll manage.

840
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,166
Jyothi.
- It's dad.

841
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,333
Dad!
- What happened? Don't cry.

842
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,208
I'm home now.
- Where had you gone?

843
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,291
We were so scared
because you took so long.

844
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:27,416
Dad, don't leave us and go.
- No, dear. I won't go.

845
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:30,541
What did you do about the car?
- I did what had to be done.

846
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:33,666
Forget about that.
- What did you do with it?

847
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,791
I have to take bath first.
Bring me a towel.

848
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,250
Aren't you at all tense?
- About what?

849
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:06,666
The guy.. - Which guy?
No guy came here.

850
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,625
We don't know anything.
- But Varun..

851
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:12,083
Who is Varun?
I've never heard of that name.

852
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,416
We have to stay unknown from now on.

853
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:21,458
Else we'll get caught because of our fear.

854
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,791
I went to office before coming home.

855
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:28,041
Simhadri immediately asked me
if there was a problem.

856
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:33,541
If Simhadri can suspect a problem,
others can as well.

857
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:38,583
Did he suspect you?
- He did at first, but I managed.

858
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:40,500
Even you have to behave normally.

859
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,500
Why don't you tell us
what you did with the car?

860
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:45,666
Look, don't be bothered
about unnecessary things.

861
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,000
Go to sleep now.
We're going out of station in the morning.

862
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:52,625
Where are we going?
- It's better we stay away for a few days.

863
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,291
Even you'll feel better.

864
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:57,375
Tell everybody that you went
to attend the preaching.

865
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,250
But that was yesterday.

866
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:01,958
Here you go.

867
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,375
Did you buy a ticket, ma'am?

868
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,000
Sir, you've come out with your whole family.
Where are you headed to?

869
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:11,500
Murli, did you buy a new bus?
- It's not new, but a second hand bus, sir.

870
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,916
I bought it at a lower price.
Where shall I give you a ticket to?

871
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,583
Vijayanagaram.
It's for some preaching.

872
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:18,166
Jyothi wanted to go, so we're all going.

873
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:21,625
Here. - Come on, Mr. Rambabu.
I can't accept money from you.

874
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:25,333
Have I ever forced you to buy a ticket?
Come on, sir.

875
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:56,250
"Every single minute"

876
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:59,500
"is accounted for."

877
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:03,208
"Every single minute spent"

878
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:06,416
"feels like eternity."

879
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:10,000
"Be it for you"

880
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:13,375
"or me."

881
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:20,541
"It's not easy to change
what has already happened."

882
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:24,083
"It's not possible to guess"

883
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:27,375
"what might happen next."

884
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:31,083
"Every single minute"

885
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:34,250
"is accounted for."

886
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:37,500
"Be it for you"

887
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,791
"or me."

888
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:45,583
"It's not possible to guess"

889
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:48,416
"what might happen next."

890
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:32,541
"Time leaves behind some wounds."

891
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:38,916
"Time also heals those wounds."

892
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:53,416
"Time leaves behind some wounds."

893
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:59,875
"Time also heals those wounds."

894
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:03,166
"Time doesn't care"

895
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:06,791
"for love, care and despair."

896
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:10,291
"But we always care"

897
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:13,583
"for our family and friends."

898
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:17,375
"Isn't life all about"

899
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:24,083
"facing time?"

900
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,750
What is this, Jyothi?
I've told you so many times.

901
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:33,958
Don't you understand?

902
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:37,833
We're not able to forget it,
how much ever we try.

903
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,083
You have to forget it.
You don't have a choice.

904
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:44,291
The cops will use our fear
against us, to prove our crime.

905
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:48,333
I'm doing everything I can
to protect our family.

906
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,791
Please trust me and do as I say.

907
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:56,125
Another thing. We need to take
bills for everything we buy.

908
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:58,458
Be it vegetables, groceries, stationary..

909
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:01,291
Always ask for a bill at the market.

910
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:05,083
"Every single minute"

911
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:08,458
"is accounted for."

912
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:12,000
"Every single minute"

913
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,791
"feels like eternity."

914
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:19,666
Connect me to cyber cell.

915
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:24,958
"Time alters the story of our life."

916
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:31,958
"Time also brings tears into our eyes."

917
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:45,791
"Time alters the story of our life."

918
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:52,625
"Time also brings tears into our eyes."

919
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:59,583
"Time passes and drags you with it."

920
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:06,416
"Time changes and expects you
to change as well."

921
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:10,208
"Even a single moment"

922
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:16,875
"can torture us for years to come."

923
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,916
Ma'am, we traced Varun's phone.

924
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:21,875
On August 2, his phone signal was traced from
Vizag, through Kothavalasa

925
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:24,791
Vijayanagaram, Srikakulam and Bhuvaneshwaram.

926
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:29,333
His phone was switched off at an industrial
area called Nimpura in Kharagpur.

927
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:34,958
Okay. As far as I know,
Varun doesn't have friends in Kharagpur.

928
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:38,708
Maybe he went
to meet his friends in Kolkata.

929
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:41,125
His phone must have
got switched off in between.

930
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,958
Possible, ma'am. We've already begun
investigation in the Kharagpur area.

931
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,791
Okay.

932
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:51,666
"Every single minute"

933
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,958
"is accounted for."

934
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,541
"Every single minute"

935
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,875
"feels like eternity."

936
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:05,291
"Be it you"

937
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:08,750
"or me."

938
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,875
"It's not easy to change"

939
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:16,125
"what has already happened."

940
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,833
"It's not possible to guess"

941
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:23,416
"what might happen next."

942
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:26,250
Seenu, come here.

943
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:52,416
Don't worry, ma'am. We found only the car.
- Who saw the car first?

944
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,958
Some of the boys
who came here for a swim, saw it.

945
01:14:57,333 --> 01:15:00,541
It looks like the car was in the water
for long. - Yes, ma'am.

946
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:01,958
It must have been more than two weeks.

947
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,375
Did you conduct a search in the water?
- You don't have to worry, sir.

948
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:07,708
We did a thorough search.

949
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:12,666
Mr. Anil Kumar, please wrap it up
before the media finds out.

950
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,208
Yes, ma'am.
- Within 24 hours

951
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:18,041
we'll find out what happened
and who's responsible.

952
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:23,875
Ma'am, the car route and the cell
phone route are very different.

953
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:28,166
On the night of August 2, the cell phone
signal was tracked at a tower in S Kota.

954
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:32,041
The phone was out of coverage
at 9.38 p.m. that night.

955
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:37,250
At 9.54 a.m. on 3rd of August, the phone was
within coverage area, at Vijayanagaram Tower.

956
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:41,208
The signal was then traced
through Srikakulam, Bhuvaneshwaram

957
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,041
and the phone was switched off at Kharagpur.

958
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,208
Ma'am, we sent the police forces

959
01:15:48,416 --> 01:15:51,583
to Kolkata and Kharagpur for
preliminary investigation

960
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,958
but there was no information.

961
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:56,416
Find out the mobile numbers
that Varun called on that day.

962
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,458
Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

963
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:06,083
Ma'am, we have proof that money
was withdrawn from the bank accounts

964
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:09,041
you spoke about,
from an ATM near Rajavaram.

965
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,375
How much is the withdrawal?
- Rs. 20,000, sir.

966
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,291
Why would he need so much money?

967
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:18,875
Sir, I have a doubt.

968
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,958
I feel that the SIM card that was
out of range on August 2

969
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,208
and the SIM that was within range on August 3
are different phones.

970
01:16:25,375 --> 01:16:27,333
The IMEI numbers are different as well.

971
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:31,041
Maybe he withdrew cash to buy a new mobile.

972
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:36,958
No. Varun bought
a new mobile quite recently.

973
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:39,833
Why would he buy another one?

974
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:46,125
Geetha, our son is in trouble.

975
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,500
Sir.

976
01:16:58,458 --> 01:17:00,375
Simhadri.
- Yes, sir. - What is this?

977
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:02,416
It's the tax bill.
- Didn't I ask you to pay it?

978
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:04,000
Actually..
- It's been three weeks.

979
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,708
I don't think it's been that long.
- What do you mean?

980
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:11,000
August 2 was a Saturday. I told you
after we came back from Vijayanagaram.

981
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,666
Right?
- Yes, sir.

982
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,125
His name is Varun.

983
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,250
He is the Inspector General
Geetha Prabhakar's son.

984
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:19,791
He's been missing since a few days.

985
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:24,208
According to his cell phone records, he was
in our village on the second of this month.

986
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:31,250
This is Varun's car.<i>
AP 31 BN 6215</i>

987
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:36,333
This car was recovered
from the quarry near Devarapalli.

988
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:23,958
Seenu, I heard your son was admitted
in the hospital. How is he now?

989
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,125
He's fine, sir.
- He's fine? - Yes.

990
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:28,541
Give me a hundred bucks then.
- I don't have that amount, sir.

991
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:31,041
Hey, you must have it.
- Sir. - Such an idiot.

992
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:33,375
You must have it in one of the pockets.
Check properly.

993
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,208
Sir. - You must have
some money for your kid's medicines.

994
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:38,583
No, sir.
- Hey, check properly. - Sir.

995
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,708
This is only twenty bucks. Go now.

996
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:44,166
Mister, give me half a pack of cigarettes.

997
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,750
Don't you want a special tea today?

998
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:50,583
I don't have time for that.
I have a serious case at hand.

999
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:52,875
I have to go.
- What is the case about?

1000
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:55,208
Someone drowned a yellow Maruti

1001
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:01,750
in the quarry near Devarapalli.

1002
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:10,000
Devarapalli doesn't come
under your jurisdiction, does it?

1003
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:13,250
We don't have a choice. We've special orders
from the inspector general of police.

1004
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:17,416
They asked us to inquire if the car
was seen in our village

1005
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:19,000
and where.

1006
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:21,333
I'll leave now.

1007
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,625
How come you're paying me?
- I had some change, so I just paid off.

1008
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:46,291
Veerabhadram, you're deliberately trying
to frame Rambabu in this case.

1009
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,041
I saw Rambabu drive away in that car, sir.

1010
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,625
I even tested it.

1011
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:59,750
He was terrified when I spoke
about the car at the hotel.

1012
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:03,958
I can prove it to you. If he's guilty

1013
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:07,750
then he'll look back at us before
he reaches the office. Wait and watch.

1014
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,250
Are you done?

1015
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:29,000
Veerabhadram says that he saw
Rambabu drive away in Varun's car.

1016
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:31,916
How are they related?
- Simple, sir.

1017
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:34,250
Rambabu and Veerabhadram
always have arguments.

1018
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:36,625
They even had a tiff over something recently.

1019
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,125
Sir, I suspect that Veerabhadram is trying

1020
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:43,333
to frame Rambabu in this case.
- Okay.

1021
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,875
Yes, sir. Rambabu is a good person.

1022
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:50,125
Even I know that.
But Veerabhadram is so sure..

1023
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,416
Sir. Look at this.

1024
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:56,125
I went to Sathyam's house
for passport verification

1025
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:57,833
at 7.15 a.m. on August 3.

1026
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,208
If this is true, then I could
have seen Rambabu there, right?

1027
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,125
Come here.

1028
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:13,583
Where were you on August 2?

1029
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:18,166
We went to attend the preaching
at Vijayanagaram.

1030
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:23,708
When did you return home?
- The next day which was a Sunday.

1031
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,000
What time did you come home?

1032
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:28,791
We came home in the evening.

1033
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:33,708
Where did you go for the preaching?
- Vijayanagaram.

1034
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,333
Where did you go in Vijayanagaram?
- Sai.. - Wait.

1035
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:40,458
It was at the Sai Baba temple.

1036
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:43,833
Was it at the Sai Baba temple?

1037
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:46,500
It was in the main hall of the temple.

1038
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,458
What is all this?

1039
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:54,750
Does this mean that the cops
will come here for interrogation?

1040
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:56,500
They'll definitely come.

1041
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:00,833
But I don't know when they'll come.

1042
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,541
It's better if they come late.

1043
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:08,166
But don't worry.
They don't know anything about the guy.

1044
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:10,250
They don't have any evidence.

1045
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,333
They'll try to come up with some evidence.

1046
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:16,625
They'll scare you, be nice to you

1047
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:18,791
confuse you

1048
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:21,208
and might even beat me and your mom.

1049
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:27,041
They'll go away when they
don't find any evidence.

1050
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:32,458
That's why we have to always
say the same thing.

1051
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:37,000
We have to give the same answer
to the questions that the cops ask us.

1052
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:41,958
You two, your mother and I
have to say the same thing.

1053
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,458
Understood?

1054
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:52,583
Dad, will they beat up mom and you?

1055
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:53,958
No.

1056
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,333
Don't worry about that.

1057
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,000
Consider it the punishment
that I give you when you're naughty.

1058
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:05,125
Dad, I'm very scared.

1059
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:09,041
Why are you scared when I'm here for you?

1060
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,125
Go to sleep. Come on.

1061
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:22,875
Rambabu.
- Yes.

1062
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,875
How will you prove that you were
not here on Saturday?

1063
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:31,958
Someone must have seen you
at the hotel or the office.

1064
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,458
Someone must have definitely seen me.

1065
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,708
How will you prove that we were
not here on Saturday?

1066
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:44,791
Jyothi, this incident was something
that we never expected.

1067
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,583
We have only two options.

1068
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:51,958
Either we face it bravely
or give up in fear.

1069
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:55,666
We know that we're not wrong

1070
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:58,625
so I can't convince myself to give up.

1071
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:01,333
That's why we have to face it bravely.

1072
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:05,875
Look, Jyothi, we've never been
in such a situation.

1073
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:10,875
We might not get through it.
But I believe that we would.

1074
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,583
The children and you won't go to jail.

1075
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,291
I promise you.

1076
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:23,625
I don't know if it was Rambabu or not.
- Hey, don't lie.

1077
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,458
You said that it was Rambabu, the other day.

1078
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:28,583
You said that it was him and I agreed.
I didn't say so.

1079
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,791
Hey, tell me.
- Sir, like Mr. Sathyam said

1080
01:24:31,958 --> 01:24:34,875
we thought it was Rambabu.
But I'm not sure.

1081
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:38,208
Okay. Did you see this car?
- I saw a yellow car, sir.

1082
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,750
This is a yellow car itself.
- I don't know if it's the same car.

1083
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:42,333
Why are you always in doubt?

1084
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,458
Look, you tell me what you saw.

1085
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:47,583
It seemed like the same car,
but I didn't see the number plate.

1086
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,500
You're an auto driver, aren't you?

1087
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:53,708
How many yellow cars have you seen?
- I've seen many, sir.

1088
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:57,083
The postmaster's car
is also yellow, sir.

1089
01:24:57,208 --> 01:25:01,125
Maybe we saw his car that day.
- Hey, we'll find that out. Shut up.

1090
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:04,083
Veerabhadram, what is this?
- Sorry, sir.

1091
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,083
Good morning, sir.

1092
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:16,958
Did you receive a fax?
- We received one from the IG's office.

1093
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,583
Sir, Varun went
to the nature camp last month.

1094
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:24,333
Some students from Chaitanya Junior College
also attended that camp.

1095
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:27,250
One of the girls, Anju,
is Rambabu's daughter.

1096
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,333
Sir, please trust me now at least.

1097
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:34,083
Rambabu will speak the truth
if we interrogate him properly.

1098
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:38,291
So today,
it's 'Properties of Organic Acid'.

1099
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:39,875
Ma'am.
- Yes.

1100
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:45,083
Anju, you're wanted by the principal.

1101
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:03,500
<i>The cops will recognize our fear.</i>

1102
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:05,583
<i>Our fear will prove to be
an evidence for them.</i>

1103
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,041
<i>The cops don't know
what happened at home.</i>

1104
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:12,250
<i>They will question us with
half the knowledge of the case.</i>

1105
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:14,208
<i>Answer them confidently.</i>

1106
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:18,208
<i>You should tell them
that you know Varun</i>

1107
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:21,291
<i>but not that he came home.</i>

1108
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,583
May I come in, ma'am?
- Yes, come in.

1109
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:29,166
Anju, he's Inspector Naveen.

1110
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:31,916
He wants to question you about something.

1111
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:35,791
You're Rambabu's elder daughter, aren't you?
- Yes, sir. - Okay.

1112
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,166
Do you know him?

1113
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:46,083
Isn't he Varun?
- How do you know him?

1114
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:49,583
I saw him at the nature camp
that I attended last month.

1115
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:52,416
Do you know anything else about him?

1116
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:57,041
I know that his mother is
the inspector general of police.

1117
01:26:57,208 --> 01:27:01,333
Did he tell you that? - I heard
some students talk about him in the camp.

1118
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:03,666
Do you know Varun well?
- No, sir.

1119
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:06,875
I don't know much about him.
- Is it so?

1120
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,166
Then how did you recognize him so easily?

1121
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:13,541
Everybody who attended
the nature camp knows Varun.

1122
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:16,833
There was a minor problem because of him.
- What problem?

1123
01:27:17,041 --> 01:27:19,500
He was clicking girls' pictures
at the camp.

1124
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:24,291
One girl from Hyderabad complained
to the principal about it.

1125
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:29,208
Did you meet Varun after the camp?
- No. What happened, sir?

1126
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,416
Is there any problem?
- Yes.

1127
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:34,416
We have information that you met Varun here.

1128
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:37,041
Did Varun tell you so?
- Yes.

1129
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:41,333
He must have lied, sir. - Did Varun come
to your house on the second of this month?

1130
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,125
No, sir. He didn't come.

1131
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:46,500
Sir, one minute.
Which day are you talking about?

1132
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:49,958
The second of this month.
It was a Saturday. Do you remember now?

1133
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:52,000
We had gone out of station on that day.

1134
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:55,916
Where had you gone?
- We went to attend a session

1135
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,166
on 'Family Preaching from the Divine'.

1136
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:02,041
Who all had gone?
- My mom, dad, sister and I.

1137
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:04,041
When did you return?
- The next evening.

1138
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:05,708
Did you stay in Vijayanagaram for two days?

1139
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,875
We were at the temple on Saturday.

1140
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:11,375
We stayed at a lodge, watched a movie
on Sunday morning and returned.

1141
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:13,833
What actually happened, sir?

1142
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:19,500
This guy is missing. We have proof
that he was in this village on the second.

1143
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:24,083
Because she knew the guy, we wanted
to check if they had met on that day.

1144
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:28,583
No, sir. I didn't see Varun after the camp.
- Okay. Thank you.

1145
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:29,791
Welcome, sir.

1146
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:32,500
Now you can go to your class.
- Okay, ma'am.

1147
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:51,791
Aren't you Rambabu's wife?
- Yes, sir.

1148
01:29:01,958 --> 01:29:05,583
Rambabu, you never
come home at this time.

1149
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:08,875
The principal called her and told
that you went to meet Anju at school.

1150
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:10,250
She got scared and called me.

1151
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:12,666
I went to the station and they told me
that you were at my house.

1152
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:15,250
That's why I'm home at this time.
What's the matter, sir?

1153
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:18,500
We came to enquire about a case.
- Let's sit down and talk.

1154
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:19,916
Okay.
- Please come.

1155
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,458
Rambabu, do you know this guy?
- No, sir.

1156
01:29:31,416 --> 01:29:32,791
Do you know him?

1157
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,291
No, sir.

1158
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:40,041
Have you seen this car?

1159
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:42,750
No, sir.

1160
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:47,791
What about you?
- No.

1161
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:50,208
Rambabu, let me be clear with you.

1162
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:54,166
It's better if you answer clearly as well.
- Sure, sir.

1163
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,291
This guy's name is Varun.

1164
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,583
He is the Inspector General
Geetha Prabhakar's son.

1165
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,541
He has been missing
from the past three weeks.

1166
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:05,708
Your elder daughter, Anju, met Varun
at the nature camp last month.

1167
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:11,750
We have information that Varun
came to your house in his car.

1168
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:17,166
The police department recovered this car
from the quarry near Devarapalli.

1169
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:20,000
We have two reasons as to why we are here.

1170
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,875
One is that your daughter knows Varun

1171
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:28,291
and the other is that Constable Veerabhadram
saw you drive that car.

1172
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,166
You didn't see me that day.

1173
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:40,625
I had gone to Sathyam's house
for passport verification.

1174
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:49,541
When we enquired about it, we found out
that only your daughter knows Varun here.

1175
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:54,958
So he must have come to your house.

1176
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:57,833
We were not here on that day.

1177
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:02,916
We went to attend the preaching program
at the Sai Baba temple in Vijayanagaram.

1178
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,375
We returned home in the evening,
the next day.

1179
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:11,083
Now they're talking.
What other proof do you want, sir?

1180
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,041
Rambabu, do you think this is a joke?

1181
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:21,791
Nobody asked you for the dates.

1182
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:24,958
Why is your wife telling us about
the dates

1183
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:27,791
without being asked for it?

1184
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:35,583
Rambabu, this is a serious case.

1185
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:37,791
How can you laugh like this?

1186
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:41,583
Do you think we're joking here?
- No, no, nothing like that.

1187
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:43,166
Why would I think so?

1188
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:45,833
Look at her. She's still in a shock.

1189
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:50,500
She doesn't even know
what's happening here.

1190
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:53,625
She has been like this
since the principal called.

1191
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:57,041
You know how college authorities are.

1192
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:59,333
They fear that their reputation will be ruined

1193
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,583
if the students are accused of crimes.

1194
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:06,250
That's why she got tensed
when the principal called up

1195
01:32:06,416 --> 01:32:08,416
and told her everything including the dates.

1196
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:17,541
Veerabhadram said that he saw you drive
that car on the third of this month.

1197
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,333
You didn't answer to that.

1198
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:22,250
There's nothing to say, sir.
- What do you mean?

1199
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:24,708
Everybody knows that
Veerabhadram doesn't like me.

1200
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,458
He won't trust anything I say.

1201
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:33,083
Okay, forget about that. Tell me the truth.
- I'll tell you, sir.

1202
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:36,791
If he is saying that he saw me,
then he must be lying

1203
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:38,958
or he must have mistaken
someone else for me.

1204
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:42,166
Sir, we were out of station
from 8:00 a.m. on August 2

1205
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:45,583
to 5:00 p.m. on August 3.
We were in Vijayanagaram.

1206
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:48,875
No, sir. I'm sure that I saw him
that day.

1207
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:56,333
Can you tell me what you did
and where you went

1208
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:58,916
in those days?

1209
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:00,208
Sure, sir.

1210
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,750
We left from here by bus,
at 5.30 a.m. on August 2.

1211
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:21,708
Was it raining when you returned?
- Yes, sir.

1212
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:24,958
Jyothi and the children even
contracted fever because of that.

1213
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:26,791
The children didn't
attend school for a few days.

1214
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:32,083
Sir, we've known a lot of people
who collect bills for convenience.

1215
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:35,666
This is the first time I've seen someone
collect bus tickets as well.

1216
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:37,375
Do you still trust him?

1217
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:40,083
We are a middle-class family, sir.

1218
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:44,083
We can keep account of the money spent
only by collecting bills.

1219
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,791
Okay, okay. Let's go.

1220
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:59,291
What is the area of this land, Rambabu?
- Around five acres, sir.

1221
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:02,791
Oh, okay.

1222
01:34:09,916 --> 01:34:12,791
I shouldn't have spoken, right?
- Yes.

1223
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:16,916
They believed when you
showed them the bills, right?

1224
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:24,416
Veerabhadram, after talking to them

1225
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:28,250
I feel you're trying to frame Rambabu.
- Why would I do that, sir?

1226
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:32,375
I'm sure that I saw Rambabu that day, sir.

1227
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:35,541
We'll inform
the inspector general first.

1228
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:45,750
Dad.
- Yes, dear.

1229
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:48,291
Will the cops believe what we told?

1230
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,000
I don't know, dear.

1231
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:54,708
Will the cops come again, dad?

1232
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:56,916
They will come, dear.

1233
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:12,666
What is his name?
- Rambabu, ma'am.

1234
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:15,125
Are you sure that he was driving Varun's car?

1235
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:18,083
I didn't see the number
but it was a yellow Maruti.

1236
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:21,625
Did you see Rambabu drive the car?
- I'm sure it was him, sir.

1237
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:24,583
Didn't they say that they were
out of station on those days?

1238
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,000
Sir, they're lying.

1239
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,958
You said that they showed you
evidence, didn't you?

1240
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:31,583
They showed us hotel bills and bus tickets.

1241
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:33,750
But we haven't verified
if they were original.

1242
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:36,291
If he is telling the truth

1243
01:35:36,708 --> 01:35:41,833
then Rambabu's story and evidence is fake.

1244
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:46,625
He has not even completed his schooling.

1245
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:51,541
I'm sure he would have left behind some
evidence which we can use to nab him.

1246
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:56,000
So, I want Rambabu and his
family here tomorrow morning

1247
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:57,750
with all the evidence that they showed.

1248
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:03,416
Sir! - How come
you're here so early in the morning?

1249
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:07,125
The cops have taken away Rambabu.
- Oh, no. Why?

1250
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:22,291
We left by bus at 5.30 a.m.

1251
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:24,916
Why don't you have the bus tickets?

1252
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:28,166
My husband's friend owns the bus.

1253
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:31,541
He refused to accept money from us.

1254
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:34,208
What time did you reach the Sai Baba temple?

1255
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:37,208
I think it was around 8.30 a.m.
The program had already begun.

1256
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,708
We arrived at the preaching
a little late.

1257
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:42,583
What time did you reach the temple?

1258
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:47,875
<i>They'll suspect us if we all
tell them the same time.</i>

1259
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:52,000
<i>You children need not
tell them the right time.</i>

1260
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:55,625
I'm not sure about the time

1261
01:36:55,958 --> 01:37:00,208
but the program had already begun
when we reached there.

1262
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:05,083
How long did you wait
for the program to start?

1263
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:09,333
<i>The cops might question you in different
ways to force the truth out of you.</i>

1264
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,541
<i>But you should not get tensed</i>

1265
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:14,666
<i>and only say what we've agreed upon.</i>

1266
01:37:15,333 --> 01:37:18,208
The program had begun
by the time we reached there.

1267
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:23,083
Your dad said that it started
half an hour after you reached.

1268
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:27,208
<i>The cops might confuse you</i>

1269
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,041
<i>but stick to what you said before.
Don't change it.</i>

1270
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:36,208
No. The program had begun
by the time we went there.

1271
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:45,416
Hey, what is this?
- We want to talk to Rambabu.

1272
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:47,583
Let us go inside.
- Hey, what is this?

1273
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:50,333
Even we don't know.
They're not allowing us inside.

1274
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,416
Please open the gates.
We'll talk to them and come.

1275
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,083
We've been told not to allow anybody inside.

1276
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:57,208
Hey, he is Rambabu's father-in-law.
Open the gates!

1277
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:59,375
Sir, it's for your own benefit.
Move back!

1278
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,250
Hey, shut up. You don't know what I can do.
Open the gates!

1279
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:04,625
Don't you understand if told once?
- Hey, just open the gates.

1280
01:38:05,291 --> 01:38:06,666
Open the gates!
- Hey, move back!

1281
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:09,166
Hey, how dare you?
- Move back!

1282
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:11,458
We had lunch at a hotel after that.

1283
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:12,708
Which hotel?

1284
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:17,666
I don't remember the name.

1285
01:38:17,833 --> 01:38:19,375
What did you eat?
- 'Biryani'.

1286
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:22,375
What did your parents eat?
- Even they ate 'biryani'.

1287
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:24,750
Your sister said that you all ate fried rice.

1288
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:29,458
Maybe she forgot. We ate 'biryani'.

1289
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:30,916
I remember very well.

1290
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:34,750
Mr. Naveen, this is..
- Hello.

1291
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,000
Who told you?

1292
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,041
No, no. They're just rumors.

1293
01:38:39,875 --> 01:38:40,916
It's not true.

1294
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,750
I'm in a meeting. I'll get back to you.

1295
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,125
What?
- It was a reporter from a news channel.

1296
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:49,708
They've received news
that we're interrogating a family

1297
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:52,541
in our son's missing case.
- Just leave it!

1298
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,291
So, Mr. Naveen, what
do you think about it?

1299
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,958
They're not as easy as I thought.
They're very adamant.

1300
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:00,041
All of them are saying the same thing.

1301
01:39:00,666 --> 01:39:04,166
We tried questioning them differently,
but they're confident about their answer.

1302
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:05,791
Specially their younger daughter.

1303
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:08,958
I'm shocked to see that she's so confident.
- That's it!

1304
01:39:09,333 --> 01:39:13,208
Don't you think it's strange
that the small kid is so confident?

1305
01:39:13,791 --> 01:39:15,041
Even I felt it was strange, ma'am.

1306
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:16,958
What if they're telling the truth?

1307
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:20,708
He could have lied.
- No, no.

1308
01:39:21,958 --> 01:39:23,166
I'm sure about one thing.

1309
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:26,875
They know something about Varun.

1310
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,208
But, Geetha, they are..
- Lying!

1311
01:39:30,083 --> 01:39:31,375
It's a cooked-up story.

1312
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,250
They're very shrewd.

1313
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:38,583
But it won't sell here. - Ma'am,
because we're sure that they're lying

1314
01:39:38,708 --> 01:39:41,583
let's conduct a lie detector test.
- How did you become a cop?

1315
01:39:42,458 --> 01:39:45,375
We can't conduct a lie
detector test on everybody.

1316
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:47,458
We need a court order for that.

1317
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,416
Why don't you get a court order issued?

1318
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:51,750
It's not that easy, Prabha.

1319
01:39:52,416 --> 01:39:55,333
We have to prove in the court
that they're lying.

1320
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:58,541
But we don't have any evidence
against them.

1321
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:04,250
I know how to make them speak the truth.

1322
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:09,791
I want to meet every person
that they mentioned. - Yes, ma'am.

1323
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:11,458
Not just that.

1324
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:15,166
If Rambabu hadn't gone
to attend the preaching program

1325
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:18,666
he would have stayed here, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

1326
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:21,333
He would have gone to the office, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

1327
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:25,458
Find out where else Rambabu goes
apart from his office.

1328
01:40:25,708 --> 01:40:28,916
He goes to a hotel opposite
the police station, ma'am.

1329
01:40:29,666 --> 01:40:30,666
Very good.

1330
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:35,208
Bring his office staff
and the hotel owner here.

1331
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:36,625
Okay, ma'am.

1332
01:40:39,708 --> 01:40:43,291
I felt very scared to talk to the cops.

1333
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:45,833
God has really helped us.

1334
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:49,291
I hope everything is over.
- Jyothi. - Yes.

1335
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:52,666
It's not over yet.

1336
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:54,791
The cops will come again.

1337
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:13,458
Will they come again?
- Yes.

1338
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:15,500
Why, brother-in-law?
What's the problem?

1339
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:16,958
Why don't you tell me at least?

1340
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:21,208
Look, Rajesh, every family
will have some personal issues

1341
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:22,583
that they can't tell anybody.

1342
01:41:23,875 --> 01:41:25,333
Please don't ask me anything.

1343
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:31,083
But you have to help me.
- What should I do, brother-in-law?

1344
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:40,000
I've known him as a child.
He's very innocent.

1345
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:41,583
He doesn't hurt anybody.

1346
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:44,500
I don't want
his character certificate from you.

1347
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:47,083
Just answer the question.

1348
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:53,791
How many times did Rambabu
come to your hotel on August 2?

1349
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:57,125
He generally comes twice,
for tea and dinner.

1350
01:41:57,458 --> 01:41:59,166
Sometimes, he doesn't come for dinner.

1351
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:03,041
It's difficult to guess.
- Sir, just answer the question.

1352
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:05,666
How many times did he come
to the hotel on the second?

1353
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:08,500
Okay, sir. He must have come twice.

1354
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,541
Hold on! I was wrong.

1355
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,791
Rambabu had gone out of station on that day.

1356
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:18,083
He went to attend some meeting in Vijayanagaram.

1357
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:19,250
Why didn't you tell us before?

1358
01:42:19,416 --> 01:42:21,250
I just remembered.

1359
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:24,208
Rambabu told us about the preaching as well.

1360
01:42:24,625 --> 01:42:25,666
What did he tell you?

1361
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:28,250
He said that his sermons
were very valuable for life.

1362
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:34,208
He even told us a few stories.
- What stories?

1363
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:38,958
It was a story about the soul of Sai Baba
visiting Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.

1364
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,833
When did Rambabu return from Vijayanagaram?

1365
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:43,083
He returned the next day.
- What time?

1366
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:45,208
He didn't come to office that day.

1367
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,625
Do you know them?
- Yes, ma'am.

1368
01:42:54,791 --> 01:42:56,125
Did they board
your bus recently?

1369
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:58,125
They boarded my bus
a few days ago.

1370
01:42:58,416 --> 01:42:59,958
Have they ever travelled
on your bus before that?

1371
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:03,666
Yes, sir. It was on the second of this month.

1372
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:06,291
Where were they headed to?
- They said they were going to Vijayanagaram.

1373
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,750
They said they were going
to attend some preaching.

1374
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:15,833
Are you sure that they stayed at your lodge?

1375
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:19,625
Yes, sir.
- Is he a regular customer? - No, sir.

1376
01:43:19,791 --> 01:43:22,333
How do you remember them so clearly then?

1377
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:25,583
<i>I want a double room.
- Sir, that will be Rs. 650 plus tax.</i>

1378
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:27,416
<i>I didn't pay the tax
when I came here the last time.</i>

1379
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:28,958
<i>Maybe you didn't ask for the bill.</i>

1380
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:30,375
<i>I don't want the bill.</i>

1381
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,458
<i>Rambabu, is this a family lodge?
Let's go to another lodge.</i>

1382
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:41,041
<i>Ma'am, this is a family lodge.
You'll like the room.</i>

1383
01:43:41,208 --> 01:43:45,583
They agreed to stay at the lodge
only when I showed them the room.

1384
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:49,041
Do you remember
when they stayed at the lodge?

1385
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:50,875
I don't remember, sir.

1386
01:43:51,541 --> 01:43:53,791
Did they tell you why
they had come to Vijayanagaram?

1387
01:43:54,083 --> 01:43:55,333
They didn't tell me, sir.

1388
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:57,625
Did you check the register?
- Yes, ma'am.

1389
01:43:57,833 --> 01:43:59,583
They maintain two registers.

1390
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:01,916
One of the registers has Rambabu's name.

1391
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:07,166
They checked in on August 2 and
checked out the next day at 9:00 a.m.

1392
01:44:08,291 --> 01:44:10,541
Why do you maintain two registers?

1393
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:13,750
Why don't you give her an explanation?

1394
01:44:13,916 --> 01:44:16,208
One of the registers is
for people who ask for the bill

1395
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,875
and the other is for people
who don't ask for the bill.

1396
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:19,875
Don't you know that's wrong?

1397
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:26,500
How do you remember them even after so long?

1398
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:29,166
How can we forget good customers, ma'am?

1399
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:31,708
<i>Are you the hotel owner?
- Yes, sir. Why?</i>

1400
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:34,291
<i>I've never eaten a tastier 'biryani'.</i>

1401
01:44:35,208 --> 01:44:38,500
<i>This is the only hotel that serves
good 'biryani' in Vijayanagaram.</i>

1402
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:40,583
<i>Even your service was good.</i>

1403
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:42,083
<i>The hotel is hygienic as well.
- Thank you.</i>

1404
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,333
<i>Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

1405
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,416
<i>We do home delivery as well.
You can leave your number here.</i>

1406
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:46,541
<i>We don't stay at Vijayanagaram.</i>

1407
01:44:46,708 --> 01:44:50,041
<i>Sir, the 'biryani' was very tasty.
- Is it so? Thanks, dear.</i>

1408
01:44:50,208 --> 01:44:51,416
<i>Did you come to Vijayanagaram for shopping?</i>

1409
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:54,625
<i>No, sir. We came for the preaching
program at the Sai Baba temple.</i>

1410
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,208
<i>We'll leave now, sir.
- All right.</i>

1411
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:59,916
It's good that you remember good customers.

1412
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:02,791
But it's strange that you're mentioning
their date of arrival

1413
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:05,166
and their reason of visit.
- What's so strange, sir?

1414
01:45:05,625 --> 01:45:07,833
We don't remember customers
who just eat and leave.

1415
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:12,583
But we always remember customers
who talk to us, appreciate us

1416
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:14,375
and pay us in person.
- Okay, okay.

1417
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:16,458
Okay, wait outside.
- All right.

1418
01:45:20,583 --> 01:45:22,041
What is this mystery?

1419
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:24,916
If they were
at home on both the days

1420
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,833
how could Rambabu

1421
01:45:27,916 --> 01:45:31,916
meet all these people?

1422
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:33,583
Even I'm confused, ma'am.

1423
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:37,666
Geetha,
maybe Rambabu is telling the truth.

1424
01:45:37,958 --> 01:45:39,833
I doubt that the constable is lying.

1425
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:43,500
No, sir. I'm not lying.

1426
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:45,625
I saw Rambabu drive away in the car.

1427
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:48,750
I'll quit my job if I'm proved wrong.

1428
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:54,166
Did you contact the person
who delivered sermons at Vijayanagaram?

1429
01:45:54,375 --> 01:45:57,750
Based on what you're saying

1430
01:45:57,958 --> 01:46:00,083
he must have attended the program.

1431
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:02,916
I'm sure about this because
I've never narrated the stories

1432
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:08,500
that I narrated at Vijayanagaram,
before that.

1433
01:46:08,625 --> 01:46:13,125
It wouldn't have been possible
for him to have known them otherwise.

1434
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:15,541
Isn't it possible that someone
who attended your program

1435
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:16,791
could have told him?

1436
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:22,458
The preachings that I gave
are not easy to remember.

1437
01:46:33,166 --> 01:46:34,208
<i>Four tickets</i>

1438
01:46:40,416 --> 01:46:43,041
<i>What about dad and Anu?
- Let's go inside.</i>

1439
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,041
<i>This is the digital projector.</i>

1440
01:46:49,291 --> 01:46:51,458
<i>I want to build a theatre in my village.
- Sure, sir.</i>

1441
01:46:51,666 --> 01:46:53,041
<i>The investment will be much less
because of the digital projector.</i>

1442
01:46:53,166 --> 01:46:54,333
<i>Even the maintenance is easy.</i>

1443
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:57,875
<i>That's my wife and my elder daughter.
- Greetings!</i>

1444
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,208
<i>Greetings.
- Greetings.</i>

1445
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:04,625
Do you remember the day
they came to your theatre?

1446
01:47:04,833 --> 01:47:06,208
They came on August 3.

1447
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:10,041
How are you so sure about the date?

1448
01:47:10,333 --> 01:47:12,291
He watched the movie
sitting in the projector room.

1449
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:15,250
He even told me that they had come
to attend some program

1450
01:47:15,458 --> 01:47:18,625
and that they had stayed at a hotel.
That's all.

1451
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:21,958
Just get out!
- You may go now.

1452
01:47:28,541 --> 01:47:29,583
Geetha

1453
01:47:31,125 --> 01:47:33,833
control yourself. Come on.

1454
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,791
Prabha, our son..

1455
01:47:50,708 --> 01:47:51,958
Nothing will happen to him.

1456
01:47:53,416 --> 01:47:54,541
Be brave.

1457
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:57,958
We'll find out where he is.

1458
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,208
Don't lose hope.

1459
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:06,791
Geetha, do you think that the investigation
is headed in the right direction?

1460
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:12,333
Yes, I think so.
- We haven't found any evidence.

1461
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:15,875
All the evidence points out
that they're innocent.

1462
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:18,000
See, Prabha

1463
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:23,208
I'm not saying this
based on the evidence we have.

1464
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:27,458
We cops come to know whether
a person is telling the truth

1465
01:48:27,875 --> 01:48:29,666
or hiding the truth from us

1466
01:48:29,833 --> 01:48:34,208
based on their words or behavior.

1467
01:48:34,416 --> 01:48:36,333
We're trained for that.

1468
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:41,083
We might not have any evidence against him

1469
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:45,291
but I know that he's lying.

1470
01:48:46,458 --> 01:48:51,333
He's lying, Prabha!
I can feel it. I can feel it.

1471
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:56,541
Maybe a mother who has lost her son

1472
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:00,583
will always think like this.

1473
01:49:02,583 --> 01:49:03,708
Geetha.

1474
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:11,208
Thinking otherwise, I've underestimated him.

1475
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:15,500
A person who has not completed schooling

1476
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,541
can't be so clever.

1477
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:21,166
Rambabu always wishes good for the people.

1478
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:24,625
I found out everything about Rambabu, ma'am.

1479
01:49:24,916 --> 01:49:26,625
He came to this village a long time ago.

1480
01:49:26,958 --> 01:49:29,583
He started off with menial jobs
such as working at a video parlor

1481
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,583
as an automobile mechanic
and a cable operator.

1482
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:34,291
Rambabu loves movies.

1483
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:37,750
He watches movies of all languages
and watches them many times.

1484
01:49:37,958 --> 01:49:39,083
Maybe that's why

1485
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:43,708
he can speak various languages
even though he's a school dropout.

1486
01:49:43,916 --> 01:49:47,208
It's a wonder that someone can gain
so much knowledge from movies.

1487
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:48,625
Movies.

1488
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:50,750
It's an important link.

1489
01:49:51,083 --> 01:49:52,708
<i>Ticket! Ticket!
Ticket!</i>

1490
01:49:54,458 --> 01:49:56,958
Many people travel in your bus every day.

1491
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:01,208
It's not a big deal to remember
one family among them.

1492
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:03,250
But you seem to have a good memory

1493
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:06,583
because you're able to say
where they were headed to and why.

1494
01:50:08,625 --> 01:50:12,041
What are you thinking about?
She just asked you a simple question.

1495
01:50:12,708 --> 01:50:14,875
You said that they travelled
in your bus on August 3

1496
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:18,666
and that they had come after attending
a program the previous day.

1497
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:24,083
We want to know how you remember something
that happened 25 days ago.

1498
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:27,833
Actually, I don't remember
what they told that day.

1499
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:31,750
You just said that they had attended
a program on August 2.

1500
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:34,791
We spoke about that
when we met the other day.

1501
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:38,625
What do you mean?
- We met a few days ago.

1502
01:50:39,083 --> 01:50:40,208
Where did you meet him?

1503
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:46,291
<i>Sir!
- Hi, dear.</i>

1504
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:49,750
<i>You seem to be going somewhere again.
- You are..</i>

1505
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:54,666
<i>Didn't you recognize me?
- Hey, don't you remember?</i>

1506
01:50:55,083 --> 01:50:58,708
<i>He's the conductor of the bus we were in
while returning from the preaching.</i>

1507
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:00,583
<i>Yes, now I remember.</i>

1508
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:03,083
<i>You're the conductor of the bus
that we boarded on August 3</i>

1509
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:05,625
after attending the program
on August 2, right?

1510
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:09,125
Yes, sir.
- Sorry, I forgot. - That's okay.

1511
01:51:09,291 --> 01:51:11,583
I'll leave now. Let's go.
Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye.

1512
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:28,958
<i>Who.. Oh, it's you!
- Hasn't the show started yet?</i>

1513
01:51:29,166 --> 01:51:31,208
<i>No, sir. How come you're alone?
Where is your family?</i>

1514
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:33,583
<i>They haven't come. I've come alone.
- Okay.</i>

1515
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:36,083
<i>On August 2, we came here to attend
the preaching at the Sai Baba temple</i>

1516
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:38,166
<i>and came to watch a movie on August 3.
- Okay!</i>

1517
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:40,333
<i>If I bring my family again and again</i>

1518
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,375
<i>they'll spend lavishly
on shopping and eating out.</i>

1519
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:55,250
<i>Murli, you didn't let me pay for the tickets
when we went to attend the preaching</i>

1520
01:51:55,416 --> 01:51:57,958
<i>on August 2 as well. Now you have to accept it.
- Come on, sir. Convince him, ma'am.</i>

1521
01:51:58,416 --> 01:52:00,833
<i>How will you clear your debts
if you don't take money like this?</i>

1522
01:52:00,958 --> 01:52:04,166
<i>Come on, take it.
- You're too much, sir. Here you go.</i>

1523
01:52:11,833 --> 01:52:14,291
<i>Please come. You've come after so long.
- It's not that long, sir.</i>

1524
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:17,291
<i>We came to your hotel after we visited
the Sai Baba temple on August 2. - Yes.</i>

1525
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:19,625
<i>We came to the hotel on August 3, right?
- Yes.</i>

1526
01:52:24,625 --> 01:52:26,250
I didn't meet him again, ma'am.

1527
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:33,208
<i>No, sir. It's not been that long.
- Of course, it has.</i>

1528
01:52:33,416 --> 01:52:36,250
<i>We went to the preaching on August 2.</i>

1529
01:52:36,416 --> 01:52:38,291
<i>When was it? It was a Saturday, August 2.
- It was a Saturday, August 2.</i>

1530
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:41,041
<i>When did we return? August 3, understood?</i>

1531
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,750
<i>So we returned on Sunday, August 3</i>

1532
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:46,541
<i>and I asked you to pay taxes on Monday,
August 4. Didn't I tell you?</i>

1533
01:52:46,666 --> 01:52:48,000
<i>Yes, yes.
- Exactly.</i>

1534
01:52:52,125 --> 01:52:54,875
<i>All the devotees were troubled when Sai Baba</i>

1535
01:52:55,041 --> 01:52:56,333
<i>lay unconscious for three days.</i>

1536
01:52:56,708 --> 01:53:00,875
<i>But Sai Baba had actually visited
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa in his soul form.</i>

1537
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,541
<i>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa told Baba
that he was still needed</i>

1538
01:53:03,708 --> 01:53:04,625
<i>to bring Hindus and Muslims together.</i>

1539
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:07,958
<i>Rambabu, how do you know all this?
- Didn't I tell you, sir?</i>

1540
01:53:08,125 --> 01:53:10,041
<i>We had gone to attend
the preaching in Vijayanagaram</i>

1541
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:13,083
<i>on the second of this month.
It was a Saturday.</i>

1542
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:18,333
Hello.

1543
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:20,833
This is not her number.

1544
01:53:21,583 --> 01:53:25,250
Who is it?
- My disciples have made

1545
01:53:25,625 --> 01:53:27,958
a recording of my sermons.

1546
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:29,958
What! A recording?

1547
01:53:30,125 --> 01:53:34,250
Many people booked for the recording
at the Sai Baba temple.

1548
01:53:34,416 --> 01:53:37,750
I spoke to the manager,
but there is no record

1549
01:53:37,916 --> 01:53:42,041
of any person named Rambabu
to have booked the recording.

1550
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:45,875
It's possible that Rambabu booked
the recording in another name.

1551
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:47,333
It might be true.

1552
01:53:48,416 --> 01:53:50,541
But none of the people
we interrogated told us

1553
01:53:50,791 --> 01:53:53,708
that they were in the village
on those two days. So..

1554
01:53:54,791 --> 01:53:58,208
<i>We got on the bus at 5.30 a.m. on August 2.
- Rambabu was out of station.</i>

1555
01:53:58,375 --> 01:53:59,958
<i>You didn't accept money when we attended
the program in Vijayanagaram.</i>

1556
01:54:00,125 --> 01:54:04,166
<i>He said that he came to attend a
program and that he stayed at a hotel.</i>

1557
01:54:04,333 --> 01:54:05,666
<i>It was the day I attended the
preaching at the Sai Baba temple.</i>

1558
01:54:05,791 --> 01:54:09,583
<i>That's why we came to
watch the movie on August 3.</i>

1559
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:14,208
<i>We came here when we came
to the Sai Baba temple on August 2.</i>

1560
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:18,583
<i>We came to the hotel on August 3, right?</i>

1561
01:54:19,791 --> 01:54:22,166
He just recreated that day.

1562
01:54:23,666 --> 01:54:27,708
He recreated all the events
that never happened. - What?

1563
01:54:28,416 --> 01:54:29,833
Don't you get it?

1564
01:54:31,416 --> 01:54:33,166
He recreated it.

1565
01:54:34,333 --> 01:54:37,791
They didn't go anywhere on those two days.

1566
01:54:39,208 --> 01:54:42,500
But he made everybody believe that they did.

1567
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:45,416
What's the specialty of movies?

1568
01:54:46,666 --> 01:54:47,750
Scene!

1569
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:50,916
A person might not remember words

1570
01:54:51,416 --> 01:54:53,166
but will always remember what he saw.

1571
01:54:56,791 --> 01:54:58,958
They travelled for two days.

1572
01:55:00,166 --> 01:55:01,291
That's not a lie.

1573
01:55:02,416 --> 01:55:04,375
They really went to Vijayanagaram

1574
01:55:05,083 --> 01:55:06,500
and stayed there for two days.

1575
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:11,958
This is why they didn't change
their statement.

1576
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:15,208
Do you think they travelled on those days?

1577
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:17,833
That is what he recreated.

1578
01:55:18,583 --> 01:55:20,416
They must have gone to Vijayanagaram

1579
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:25,291
on the fourth or fifth.
- That must be Monday or Tuesday.

1580
01:55:25,416 --> 01:55:29,458
Ma'am, their children didn't attend
school from Monday to Wednesday.

1581
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:31,333
We questioned him about it.

1582
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:35,416
He said that they had a fever
because of the rain

1583
01:55:35,708 --> 01:55:37,583
and so they hadn't attended school.

1584
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:40,625
He showed medical bills
when we didn't trust him.

1585
01:55:41,333 --> 01:55:44,583
Anybody can issue fake
medical bills for a few bucks.

1586
01:55:46,041 --> 01:55:48,291
He's taking us for a ride

1587
01:55:49,166 --> 01:55:50,625
by showing us fake bills.

1588
01:55:51,083 --> 01:55:56,041
But their names in the lodge register
on August 2, the bus and movie tickets

1589
01:55:56,208 --> 01:55:58,458
are all real.
How can you say that they're fake?

1590
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,541
That's also an important point, ma'am.

1591
01:56:00,708 --> 01:56:03,125
We underestimated Rambabu here.

1592
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:06,375
He might not have completed his schooling

1593
01:56:07,666 --> 01:56:10,416
but he has had enough experiences in life.

1594
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,875
Now I completely understand

1595
01:56:15,416 --> 01:56:16,791
the story that he told us.

1596
01:56:17,541 --> 01:56:20,958
Rambabu went to Vijayanagaram
on August 3, in Varun's car.

1597
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:24,416
He bought a parcel at a hotel on that day.

1598
01:56:25,208 --> 01:56:28,958
Then he bought a mobile phone,
inserted Varun's SIM card in it

1599
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:32,541
and threw the phone on a lorry
which has a national permit.

1600
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:38,125
He then drowned Varun's car
in the water near the quarry.

1601
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:39,916
He then stole

1602
01:56:40,208 --> 01:56:43,875
somebody else's 'biryani' bills.

1603
01:56:44,958 --> 01:56:46,625
He then went to the cinema hall

1604
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:49,208
and bought four tickets
for the matinee show.

1605
01:56:50,416 --> 01:56:54,750
Then he got on a bus and bought
four tickets while coming home.

1606
01:56:55,833 --> 01:56:57,291
He went directly to the office

1607
01:56:57,708 --> 01:57:02,250
and reminded Simhadri
that he was going

1608
01:57:02,625 --> 01:57:04,333
to attend the preaching program.

1609
01:57:04,541 --> 01:57:09,416
On August 4, that is the next day,
he got on Murli's bus

1610
01:57:09,833 --> 01:57:13,375
and told him that they were headed to the Sai
Baba temple without him even asking about it.

1611
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:17,875
They went to the temple at 9:00 a.m.
and stayed there till the evening.

1612
01:57:18,291 --> 01:57:21,958
He found out about the recording
of the preaching at the temple

1613
01:57:22,541 --> 01:57:24,208
and booked it under somebody else's name.

1614
01:57:24,833 --> 01:57:28,750
Then they came to the lodge,
where he distracted the manager

1615
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:33,958
and entered their details
on the August 2 page of the register.

1616
01:57:34,541 --> 01:57:37,458
He must have written somebody
else's name on the August 4 page

1617
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:40,083
in a different handwriting.

1618
01:57:40,916 --> 01:57:43,708
He must have eaten at a roadside eatery

1619
01:57:44,083 --> 01:57:46,875
and asked someone to pick up a parcel

1620
01:57:47,291 --> 01:57:49,500
from the same hotel where he bought
the parcel on August 3.

1621
01:57:50,041 --> 01:57:52,166
Once they checked out of the lodge,
they went to the restaurant

1622
01:57:52,333 --> 01:57:55,750
ate 'biryani' and built a rapport
with the manager.

1623
01:57:56,208 --> 01:57:57,666
He then went to the cinema hall

1624
01:57:58,083 --> 01:58:00,500
and met the projector operator.

1625
01:58:01,458 --> 01:58:04,416
He then got on the bus and returned home.

1626
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:06,666
He even conversed with the conductor.

1627
01:58:07,041 --> 01:58:08,083
Once they returned home

1628
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:11,041
all of them watched the recording
of the preaching.

1629
01:58:12,333 --> 01:58:15,041
He got rid of all the bills
that he collected on August 5

1630
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:18,583
and presented us with the bills

1631
01:58:18,791 --> 01:58:22,291
that he collected alone on August 3.

1632
01:58:23,833 --> 01:58:27,958
He again went to Vijayanagaram
after a few days and met everybody.

1633
01:58:28,333 --> 01:58:29,750
He then repeated to everybody

1634
01:58:30,166 --> 01:58:33,750
that he had visited Vijayanagaram
on August 2

1635
01:58:33,916 --> 01:58:36,083
for them to remember.

1636
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:38,750
That's why everybody was so sure

1637
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,708
that it was on August 2.

1638
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:45,000
That's not the date
they saw Rambabu's family

1639
01:58:45,666 --> 01:58:48,625
but the date Rambabu put into their memory.

1640
01:58:50,416 --> 01:58:53,958
This is how he fooled
the entire police department.

1641
01:58:54,458 --> 01:58:58,166
We don't have any evidence
to prove this.

1642
01:58:59,541 --> 01:59:00,875
We just have a theory.

1643
01:59:01,041 --> 01:59:02,333
Geetha, if you're telling the truth

1644
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,916
then where is Varun?
Why did Varun even meet them?

1645
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:08,875
I'll make him answer for that.

1646
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:13,291
Sir, this is really unfair.
- Come on, come on.

1647
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:15,250
Move it! Move it!

1648
01:59:15,416 --> 01:59:16,708
Please move aside.

1649
01:59:18,541 --> 01:59:20,291
Dad.
- Is that all?

1650
01:59:21,791 --> 01:59:23,375
Move, move, move fast.
- Sir, what is this?

1651
01:59:23,541 --> 01:59:25,541
Please wait till the lawyer arrives.
- Hey, get lost!

1652
01:59:28,375 --> 01:59:32,875
<i>Rajesh, you have to call the media
if the police take us away again.</i>

1653
01:59:42,333 --> 01:59:43,375
Where is my son?

1654
01:59:45,125 --> 01:59:46,791
I don't know how to convince you, ma'am.

1655
01:59:47,166 --> 01:59:49,166
I've already told you that we were
out of station on that day.

1656
01:59:50,125 --> 01:59:53,416
Do you think that the cops are fools?

1657
01:59:53,833 --> 01:59:55,541
We know about the tour that you went on

1658
01:59:56,083 --> 01:59:59,000
to plant fabricated evidences.

1659
02:00:17,083 --> 02:00:19,708
Why did Varun come to meet you?

1660
02:00:22,166 --> 02:00:24,125
How are you and Varun related?

1661
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:29,416
I didn't meet Varun
after the nature camp, ma'am.

1662
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:31,000
Enough with your lies!

1663
02:00:32,666 --> 02:00:34,750
It's better if you speak the truth.

1664
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:39,458
Else, you'll be interrogated
in a different way.

1665
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:42,250
I swear, I don't know anything, ma'am.

1666
02:00:50,916 --> 02:00:53,833
Speak up at least.
Don't waste my time.

1667
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,083
It's good for everybody
if you speak the truth.

1668
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:59,666
The truth won't change
if you ask repeatedly, ma'am.

1669
02:01:00,333 --> 02:01:02,125
We don't know anything else.

1670
02:01:02,791 --> 02:01:04,500
Veerabhadram!
- Yes, ma'am.

1671
02:01:10,875 --> 02:01:14,708
No! No!
- Don't beat up my dad. Please.

1672
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:16,500
Rambabu. No!
- Mom!

1673
02:01:20,333 --> 02:01:23,541
Mom, tell him not to beat up dad.
- Speak up!

1674
02:01:23,708 --> 02:01:25,208
Dad!
- No!

1675
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:28,750
Please don't beat him.

1676
02:01:28,916 --> 02:01:30,958
Ma'am, please ask him not to beat him.

1677
02:01:32,125 --> 02:01:33,208
Dad!

1678
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:37,791
Rambabu! Rambabu!

1679
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:39,625
Just speak up!

1680
02:01:45,125 --> 02:01:46,416
Do you think this is a joke?

1681
02:01:46,708 --> 02:01:49,541
Do you think we'll believe your stories?
- Don't..

1682
02:01:50,833 --> 02:01:51,875
Rambabu!

1683
02:01:52,041 --> 02:01:53,250
Rambabu!

1684
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:57,166
Mom, ask him not to
beat up dad. Please.

1685
02:02:12,625 --> 02:02:15,250
Veerabhadram, that's enough.

1686
02:02:27,708 --> 02:02:28,750
Dad!

1687
02:02:46,083 --> 02:02:49,083
Where is my son?
- We really don't know.

1688
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,375
Don't you understand?

1689
02:02:53,875 --> 02:02:55,333
Speak the truth.

1690
02:02:57,708 --> 02:03:00,458
We really don't know.
- Speak up!

1691
02:03:02,833 --> 02:03:05,791
Hey, speak up! Come on.

1692
02:03:07,166 --> 02:03:08,416
Speak up!

1693
02:03:08,625 --> 02:03:11,041
How dare you? Speak up.

1694
02:03:11,666 --> 02:03:13,833
I won't spare you. Speak up.

1695
02:03:15,166 --> 02:03:17,500
Just tell the truth. Speak up!

1696
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:22,625
Speak up!
- Speak up!

1697
02:03:23,041 --> 02:03:24,375
Hey, speak the truth.

1698
02:03:24,916 --> 02:03:26,833
You won't budge that easily.

1699
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:29,125
Varun's friend, Shrikant is here.

1700
02:03:30,041 --> 02:03:31,041
Ask them to stop.

1701
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:32,916
Stop it! That's enough.

1702
02:03:34,916 --> 02:03:35,916
Come with me.

1703
02:03:40,958 --> 02:03:42,250
Hey, speak up..
- Veerabhadram!

1704
02:03:42,958 --> 02:03:46,250
That's enough! Go away.
- Sir, he..

1705
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:48,500
Enough! Go.

1706
02:04:07,291 --> 02:04:11,375
Rambabu, just tell what you know
about the inspector general's son.

1707
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:12,750
Why are you getting beaten up?

1708
02:04:14,125 --> 02:04:16,375
I have already told you
that I don't know anything.

1709
02:04:18,166 --> 02:04:19,416
What's the actual problem?

1710
02:04:21,625 --> 02:04:22,958
Why don't you tell us
if you know something?

1711
02:04:23,416 --> 02:04:24,666
Why are you getting beaten up?

1712
02:04:32,458 --> 02:04:35,333
Do you know this girl?
- No, ma'am.

1713
02:04:36,125 --> 02:04:40,041
Look, Shrikant, we know that Varun
and you attended the nature camp.

1714
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,333
Varun has been missing from 26 days.

1715
02:04:42,583 --> 02:04:45,041
This girl is somehow related
to that.

1716
02:04:45,916 --> 02:04:48,125
It's better if you tell us what you know.

1717
02:04:48,416 --> 02:04:51,083
I swear, sir. I don't know anything.

1718
02:04:51,416 --> 02:04:54,458
You were the last person to call
Varun on the day he went missing.

1719
02:04:55,083 --> 02:04:56,750
If you keep lying

1720
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:59,625
then I know how to make you speak the truth.

1721
02:04:59,791 --> 02:05:01,541
I swear, ma'am. I'm telling the truth.

1722
02:05:01,666 --> 02:05:04,458
He did answer his phone
when I called up

1723
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:07,416
but he didn't tell me where he was going.

1724
02:05:07,583 --> 02:05:10,375
Okay. How is this girl related to Varun?

1725
02:05:11,958 --> 02:05:13,625
You know the truth. Tell me!

1726
02:05:13,791 --> 02:05:16,291
Hey, speak the truth!
- Wait! Wait.

1727
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:18,875
Don't scare him. He'll tell the truth.

1728
02:05:19,958 --> 02:05:21,083
Come on, tell us.

1729
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:51,166
<i>Hey. - Yes.
- Share the video with me.</i>

1730
02:05:51,666 --> 02:05:54,500
<i>Sorry. Don't ask for this video.</i>

1731
02:05:54,791 --> 02:05:57,166
<i>What's the problem?
Share it through Bluetooth.</i>

1732
02:05:57,833 --> 02:06:02,791
<i>This is not an ordinary video.
This is a special case.</i>

1733
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:07,958
Ma'am.
- Come in.

1734
02:06:09,791 --> 02:06:11,416
There are a lot of people
who have gathered outside.

1735
02:06:11,583 --> 02:06:12,750
Even the media has arrived.

1736
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,416
We don't know how they found out
about it.

1737
02:06:14,583 --> 02:06:17,125
They want to talk to you.
- I won't talk to anybody.

1738
02:06:18,083 --> 02:06:20,208
I don't want anybody
to enter the guesthouse.

1739
02:06:21,333 --> 02:06:24,625
Naveen. - Ma'am. - Call for extra
police support, if you have to.

1740
02:06:24,791 --> 02:06:26,958
Okay, ma'am. - Come on.

1741
02:06:32,375 --> 02:06:34,666
I'm scared of how worse
this matter can get, Geetha.

1742
02:06:35,666 --> 02:06:38,750
Yes! It's time to end this.

1743
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,083
Everybody, go out!

1744
02:06:42,333 --> 02:06:43,416
Veerabhadram, you can stay.

1745
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:55,333
I found out about the nature camp video.

1746
02:06:57,041 --> 02:06:58,375
What did you do with my son?

1747
02:06:58,625 --> 02:07:00,208
I have already told you
that we don't know anything.

1748
02:07:07,333 --> 02:07:09,333
I want to know the truth.
- Okay.

1749
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:11,500
Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

1750
02:07:16,375 --> 02:07:17,416
Dad!

1751
02:07:18,333 --> 02:07:20,083
How dare you lie to the cops?

1752
02:07:22,875 --> 02:07:25,166
No! Let go of him.
- Hey!

1753
02:07:30,833 --> 02:07:32,083
Geetha, this is not right.

1754
02:07:32,291 --> 02:07:33,500
I won't spare you.
- Mom!

1755
02:07:33,666 --> 02:07:36,458
Speak up!
Will you speak up or not?

1756
02:07:37,958 --> 02:07:39,958
Speak up!

1757
02:07:40,083 --> 02:07:42,375
You'll have to.

1758
02:07:44,958 --> 02:07:47,916
Speak up! Come on.
- Mom!

1759
02:07:50,916 --> 02:07:52,375
You know the truth.
- No!

1760
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:53,958
Come on, speak up the truth.

1761
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:56,416
There must have been some reason.

1762
02:07:57,791 --> 02:08:00,416
Speak up.

1763
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:03,458
Speak up! Come on, speak up.
- Hey!

1764
02:08:07,625 --> 02:08:09,916
How dare you beat up a police officer!

1765
02:08:12,166 --> 02:08:15,291
Hey! Speak up!
- Dad! - Rambabu!

1766
02:08:19,875 --> 02:08:23,541
I won't spare any of you
if you don't speak up the truth.

1767
02:08:23,708 --> 02:08:25,333
We don't know anything.
- Don't you know?

1768
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:27,875
Speak up!

1769
02:08:41,250 --> 02:08:42,458
Anju!

1770
02:08:42,875 --> 02:08:46,791
Anju!
- Speak up the truth.

1771
02:08:52,375 --> 02:08:53,541
Anju!

1772
02:09:31,791 --> 02:09:34,083
If you don't speak the truth

1773
02:09:34,916 --> 02:09:36,750
then I'll not spare your parents.

1774
02:09:38,791 --> 02:09:40,666
Tell me the truth

1775
02:09:41,291 --> 02:09:42,583
if you want your parents to live.

1776
02:09:46,291 --> 02:09:47,500
Shall I kill them?

1777
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:49,791
Speak up!

1778
02:10:05,791 --> 02:10:07,125
Veerabhadram!

1779
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:13,708
Why are you so stubborn?

1780
02:10:14,291 --> 02:10:17,291
Please tell us if you know something.

1781
02:10:22,875 --> 02:10:26,333
Where is Anu?
- Anu! Anu! - Wait!

1782
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:27,958
You can't go inside.
- Sir, it's my daughter.

1783
02:10:28,166 --> 02:10:30,416
You can't go inside.
- Anu! Sir.

1784
02:10:33,083 --> 02:10:35,583
This guy came to your house, didn't he?

1785
02:10:36,875 --> 02:10:38,458
I don't know anything, sir.

1786
02:10:39,958 --> 02:10:41,916
I want to go to my parents.

1787
02:10:42,791 --> 02:10:44,375
I'll take you to your parents

1788
02:10:46,041 --> 02:10:47,750
if you stop crying and speak up.

1789
02:10:49,416 --> 02:10:52,333
Come on, tell me.
Tell me!

1790
02:10:52,625 --> 02:10:56,958
Speak up the truth
before I get angry.

1791
02:10:58,958 --> 02:11:01,500
Else I'll not spare any of you.

1792
02:11:01,916 --> 02:11:03,208
Understood?

1793
02:11:06,166 --> 02:11:09,333
This is enough, dad.
Let's tell them the truth.

1794
02:11:09,833 --> 02:11:12,958
They'll not spare Anu
if we don't speak out the truth.

1795
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:18,041
He is such a monster.
I'm very scared.

1796
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:21,375
I can't see the children suffer.

1797
02:11:22,125 --> 02:11:25,750
I'll confess to the crime. That
will help us get rid of the problem.

1798
02:11:25,916 --> 02:11:28,875
Hey, did we tolerate all this to confess?

1799
02:11:29,458 --> 02:11:31,500
You won't get arrested. I promise you.

1800
02:11:32,125 --> 02:11:34,958
I will keep up my promise,
even if I have to sacrifice my life.

1801
02:11:35,416 --> 02:11:38,166
But, Anu..
- Jyothi, they won't hurt Anu.

1802
02:11:38,458 --> 02:11:39,750
Don't worry about that.

1803
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:42,333
She'll be fine. I believe so.

1804
02:11:45,458 --> 02:11:47,958
Hey, speak up!
- I don't know anything, sir.

1805
02:11:48,666 --> 02:11:51,041
Take me to my parents.

1806
02:11:52,416 --> 02:11:54,541
Geetha, this is too much.
Let's stop this.

1807
02:11:55,291 --> 02:11:56,750
This is illegal.

1808
02:11:57,416 --> 02:11:59,583
What about Varun then?

1809
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:02,458
Let's conduct an inquiry.
But just stop this.

1810
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:04,875
Spare that child at least.

1811
02:12:05,541 --> 02:12:07,291
We've tortured them enough.

1812
02:12:07,916 --> 02:12:11,458
Even then they didn't utter a single word.

1813
02:12:11,875 --> 02:12:14,083
If they're really not related to this case

1814
02:12:14,333 --> 02:12:16,875
we'll have to regret all our life
for torturing them so much.

1815
02:12:17,791 --> 02:12:20,833
You believed a constable
and created such a scene.

1816
02:12:21,208 --> 02:12:23,750
What if he is lying?
What will we do then?

1817
02:12:38,083 --> 02:12:39,166
Veerabhadram!

1818
02:12:39,333 --> 02:12:42,125
Don't kill me. I'll tell you everything.

1819
02:12:48,916 --> 02:12:51,458
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you.

1820
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,333
Dad!
- Hey!

1821
02:13:07,708 --> 02:13:09,375
Dad!
- Anu! - Sir.

1822
02:13:09,541 --> 02:13:10,541
Anu!
- Sir.

1823
02:13:12,333 --> 02:13:13,625
Where is she taking my daughter to?

1824
02:13:14,208 --> 02:13:16,458
They're taking her to the place
where Varun is buried.

1825
02:13:18,458 --> 02:13:19,916
Your story has come to an end, Rambabu.

1826
02:13:21,375 --> 02:13:25,708
Your family and you
can live happily in jail.

1827
02:13:26,208 --> 02:13:28,458
Hey! Bring them to the jeep.

1828
02:14:03,833 --> 02:14:05,958
Why are you doing this?
- Hey, move aside.

1829
02:14:07,458 --> 02:14:08,625
Move aside! Move aside!

1830
02:14:08,916 --> 02:14:11,041
This is my daughter's house.
Let me go inside.

1831
02:14:12,666 --> 02:14:14,583
Nobody is allowed near the culprits.

1832
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:16,625
Why are they the culprits?
What have they done?

1833
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:17,708
Wait for some time and you'll know.

1834
02:14:17,875 --> 02:14:20,333
Why should we wait?
- What actually happened, sir?

1835
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,500
Even we don't know.

1836
02:14:21,666 --> 02:14:23,833
That lady who is injured is my daughter.

1837
02:14:24,166 --> 02:14:25,958
The person next to her is my son-in-law.

1838
02:14:27,208 --> 02:14:29,250
They took them for an inquiry and beat them up.

1839
02:14:29,375 --> 02:14:31,666
Why would the cops do this
without any reason?

1840
02:14:31,833 --> 02:14:33,375
The inspector general's son is missing.

1841
02:14:37,166 --> 02:14:39,541
This is a serious case.
Use this for the breaking news.

1842
02:14:39,833 --> 02:14:42,166
Rambabu is a good man.
You can ask anybody here.

1843
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:46,000
That person there is
Constable Veerabhadram.

1844
02:14:46,208 --> 02:14:48,083
He wants to frame Rambabu in this case.

1845
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:50,041
My daughter and son-in-law
don't know anything.

1846
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:52,916
They're trying to frame them.

1847
02:15:56,583 --> 02:15:58,375
Dad!
- Anu.

1848
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:04,500
I got scared, dad, and told them everything.

1849
02:16:04,666 --> 02:16:06,333
Did he hit you?
- Yes, dad.

1850
02:16:06,833 --> 02:16:11,333
He even hit such a small child.

1851
02:16:26,541 --> 02:16:29,375
You'll be fine now.
Are you angry with me?

1852
02:16:29,541 --> 02:16:32,500
No, dad. Was it wrong to confess?

1853
02:16:32,666 --> 02:16:35,083
No, dear. It was right on your part.

1854
02:17:21,791 --> 02:17:23,291
Rajesh!
- What happened, brother-in-law?

1855
02:17:23,583 --> 02:17:25,333
Constable Veerabhadram hit my daughter

1856
02:17:25,458 --> 02:17:27,583
though we told them
that we didn't know anything.

1857
02:17:28,916 --> 02:17:32,083
Veerabhadram deliberately dragged
my family to the police station.

1858
02:17:32,208 --> 02:17:35,458
Hey, Rambabu!
- Wait, Veerabhadram!

1859
02:17:35,666 --> 02:17:38,541
He is Veerabhadram.
- Don't you dare.. - Hey!

1860
02:17:38,875 --> 02:17:41,125
What will you do?
- That's him. He hit my daughter.

1861
02:17:41,291 --> 02:17:43,708
I'll hit her again. What will you do?

1862
02:17:47,125 --> 02:17:50,208
Ma'am, we've got to move.
- Geetha, come on.

1863
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:03,958
Come on, dear. Tell them everything.

1864
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:06,916
I'm here. Nobody can hurt you.
Tell them everything.

1865
02:18:07,041 --> 02:18:10,208
<i>The court has decided
that Rambabu's family is innocent</i>

1866
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:13,166
<i>in the missing case of the inspector
general's son, Varun.</i>

1867
02:18:13,458 --> 02:18:15,500
<i>The court has also suspended
Constable Veerabhadram</i>

1868
02:18:15,625 --> 02:18:19,125
<i>for misguiding the authorities.
- Yes!</i>

1869
02:18:19,291 --> 02:18:23,416
<i>Some of the cops have been
transferred to other places as well.</i>

1870
02:18:23,708 --> 02:18:26,333
<i>Inspector General Geetha Prabhakar
has been sent on leave.</i>

1871
02:18:26,625 --> 02:18:29,541
<i>The district court has ordered
the police to take permission</i>

1872
02:18:29,708 --> 02:18:33,708
<i>before interrogating
Rambabu's family again.</i>

1873
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,125
Rambabu. Rambabu.

1874
02:18:38,166 --> 02:18:39,375
Look at this!

1875
02:18:42,416 --> 02:18:44,708
<i>Inspector General
Geetha Prabhakar resigns.</i>

1876
02:18:49,416 --> 02:18:52,500
She gave up her job because of us.

1877
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:57,416
She might be a police officer,
but she is a mother first.

1878
02:18:58,250 --> 02:19:01,875
Were we unfair in taking away her son
from her?

1879
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:04,708
You're thinking in this manner
because you're a good person.

1880
02:19:05,583 --> 02:19:07,083
Wouldn't she have protected her son

1881
02:19:07,250 --> 02:19:08,458
if something had happened to Anju
because of her son?

1882
02:19:08,833 --> 02:19:12,750
She would have definitely saved him.

1883
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:17,583
Besides, who are we to decide
what's right or wrong?

1884
02:19:18,458 --> 02:19:20,208
Humans are always self-centered.

1885
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:23,708
That's a human tendency, Jyothi.

1886
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:28,958
So let's not feel bad, and forget about this.

1887
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:36,916
When did you take out the body from there?

1888
02:19:41,875 --> 02:19:43,125
Sunday.

1889
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:45,541
The night I drowned the car.

1890
02:19:47,041 --> 02:19:48,166
Where is the body now?

1891
02:20:07,791 --> 02:20:09,083
No, Jyothi.

1892
02:20:09,875 --> 02:20:11,541
Nobody should find out about this.

1893
02:20:12,333 --> 02:20:16,625
It shall remain with me
until I die.

1894
02:20:17,583 --> 02:20:18,916
That will keep you safe.

1895
02:20:24,041 --> 02:20:27,625
Did you think that Anu would
not speak up till the end?

1896
02:20:30,458 --> 02:20:33,791
To be honest with you,
everything was unexpected.

1897
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,958
You all were more adamant than I had expected.

1898
02:20:38,916 --> 02:20:42,083
Poor Anu. She tolerated
everything for so long.

1899
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:48,833
You faced so many problems
because of me, didn't you?

1900
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:50,625
What are you saying?

1901
02:20:50,958 --> 02:20:53,458
You did all this to protect us.

1902
02:20:53,916 --> 02:20:54,916
Dad!

1903
02:20:56,791 --> 02:20:58,166
The cops have come again, dad.

1904
02:21:00,875 --> 02:21:03,333
What is it?
Do you want to torture them again?

1905
02:21:03,458 --> 02:21:04,958
It's not like that.
- Why have you come then?

1906
02:21:05,416 --> 02:21:06,500
We've come here for Rambabu.

1907
02:21:22,375 --> 02:21:23,916
What happened, sir?
- It's nothing.

1908
02:21:24,041 --> 02:21:26,750
Is there an issue again?
- No, I'll manage. Don't worry.

1909
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:29,458
I'll change my clothes and come.

1910
02:21:56,791 --> 02:21:58,625
She is not here today

1911
02:21:59,291 --> 02:22:00,958
as a police officer.

1912
02:22:02,875 --> 02:22:06,833
She has come here as a mother
who has lost her son.

1913
02:22:09,458 --> 02:22:13,583
Varun was our only child.

1914
02:22:14,833 --> 02:22:18,458
Maybe that's why we created a huge scene.

1915
02:22:19,666 --> 02:22:20,750
But

1916
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:25,541
we never thought that
it would make us feel so guilty.

1917
02:22:28,125 --> 02:22:31,875
When we thought about the whole incident
being composed

1918
02:22:33,416 --> 02:22:34,708
we understood one thing.

1919
02:22:36,291 --> 02:22:38,333
We were wrong

1920
02:22:38,833 --> 02:22:43,041
to have not taught
the right values to our son.

1921
02:22:48,291 --> 02:22:52,416
We've hurt your family a lot.

1922
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:55,250
We feel sorry.

1923
02:22:57,666 --> 02:23:01,708
Please forget about it and forgive us.

1924
02:23:04,458 --> 02:23:06,791
We're shifting abroad in a few days.

1925
02:23:07,375 --> 02:23:09,458
We're leaving behind everything here.

1926
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:12,958
But there is one thing that's stopping us.

1927
02:23:14,333 --> 02:23:17,708
Every time the doorbell or the phone rings

1928
02:23:18,916 --> 02:23:21,125
we expect it to be Varun.

1929
02:23:22,666 --> 02:23:25,041
We feel heartbroken

1930
02:23:26,916 --> 02:23:28,625
every time we know that it's not him.

1931
02:23:31,625 --> 02:23:34,541
That's why I'm asking you.

1932
02:23:36,083 --> 02:23:40,583
Can we expect Varun
to come back some day?

1933
02:23:45,083 --> 02:23:46,333
I get it.

1934
02:23:47,541 --> 02:23:48,958
You don't trust us.

1935
02:23:51,250 --> 02:23:52,666
We're responsible for that.

1936
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:58,166
Please forgive us

1937
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:01,583
for causing you trouble.

1938
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:13,541
Come on. Let's go.

1939
02:24:23,125 --> 02:24:24,583
You are very influential.

1940
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:32,708
You knew you were wrong
and accepted your mistake.

1941
02:24:33,916 --> 02:24:35,500
That's a great thing.

1942
02:24:36,333 --> 02:24:40,041
I'm not that great.
I'm just a common man.

1943
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:43,125
My family matters the most to me.

1944
02:24:44,333 --> 02:24:46,166
There's nothing else
that I value more than that

1945
02:24:46,916 --> 02:24:48,125
nor do I want to.

1946
02:24:49,708 --> 02:24:52,083
A stranger entered my life.

1947
02:24:53,666 --> 02:24:56,541
He tried to ruin the people

1948
02:24:57,916 --> 02:25:00,125
who meant the world to me.

1949
02:25:02,291 --> 02:25:04,208
He didn't agree though we begged him.

1950
02:25:05,916 --> 02:25:07,375
Things took an unexpected turn.

1951
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:11,958
I was forced to get rid of him forever.

1952
02:25:21,958 --> 02:25:23,666
On that day, we didn't realize

1953
02:25:23,875 --> 02:25:27,000
that another family would also face a loss.

1954
02:25:28,791 --> 02:25:30,166
From that day on

1955
02:25:30,750 --> 02:25:33,125
we wanted to beg for forgiveness.

1956
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,875
We even apologized.

1957
02:25:38,291 --> 02:25:40,041
We can't do anything else, sir.

1958
02:25:42,041 --> 02:25:44,916
Every man lives to see
his child's future secured.

1959
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:50,958
No father can see his
child's future getting ruined.

1960
02:25:52,625 --> 02:25:54,083
Even I couldn't tolerate it.

1961
02:25:55,291 --> 02:25:58,708
You were humble enough
to confront us in person.

1962
02:25:58,875 --> 02:26:01,208
Please forgive us as well.

1963
02:26:33,333 --> 02:26:35,291
Rambabu,
the sub-inspector is calling you.

1964
02:26:41,125 --> 02:26:43,208
Sir, I'll keep my bag in the quarters.
- Okay.

1965
02:26:47,375 --> 02:26:49,166
Sir, this is Rambabu.

1966
02:26:50,208 --> 02:26:54,416
I know him. I've seen him
in the newspapers and on television.

1967
02:26:56,250 --> 02:26:57,500
Sign it.

1968
02:26:59,666 --> 02:27:02,166
Do you think the cops
won't trouble you anymore?

1969
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:07,708
I'll be here for a few years.

1970
02:27:07,875 --> 02:27:10,500
I won't spare you
even if I find a small clue.

1971
02:27:10,666 --> 02:27:13,375
You'll be sent to jail directly.

1972
02:27:14,083 --> 02:27:16,625
Do you think the cops are fools?
- No, sir.

1973
02:27:16,958 --> 02:27:18,208
I never thought so.

1974
02:27:18,666 --> 02:27:21,750
I have a lot of respect
for the police department.

1975
02:27:22,041 --> 02:27:24,291
Because of people like you

1976
02:27:24,666 --> 02:27:27,458
the police station will protect me, sir.

1977
02:28:27,875 --> 02:28:29,583
<i>We're completing the flooring
in the station.</i>

1978
02:28:29,791 --> 02:28:30,875
<i>Only the sub-inspector's room is left
to be done.</i>

1979
02:28:31,083 --> 02:28:33,333
<i>I'll help you once the work there
is finished on Monday.</i>
