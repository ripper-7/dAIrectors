1
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,722
Rocky and Rani

2
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:11,987
Rocky and Rani

3
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:15,587
Rocky and Rani's Love Story

4
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:24,801
Welcome friends! This is our
White House.

5
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,706
First copy of the famous USA
White House.

6
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:31,337
We are crazy rich Indians.
In other words, the Randhawa family.

7
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,296
Standing on a foundation
of flour laddoos.

8
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,504
Mind you, they aren't your
run-of-the mill laddoos.

9
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:41,879
Made from grandma's recipes -
the one and only Dhanlakshmi Randhawa.

10
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:47,921
Through blood and sweat, grandma made
our business reach a turnover of millions.

11
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:50,921
What a woman! Wonder woman!
Wakanda Forever!

12
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,921
So bland!

13
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,296
These artificial sweeteners spoil them.

14
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:00,921
Better to be struck down
by diabetes.

15
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,462
We have further options, ma'am.

16
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:05,212
What are you waiting for?
Go! Get another!

17
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:09,254
According to grandma, the sea is
made up of tiny drops of water,

18
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,337
and a laddoo is made up
of tiny flour balls.

19
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:14,004
Quick FB. Not Facebook, I mean
flash-back!

20
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:17,504
Grandma married Kanwal Lund.
Son of Lund, the sweet maker.

21
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,962
She thought a sweet life
would follow.

22
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:24,712
But on the very first day, just as she
was about to bow in respect...

23
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:25,671
No!

24
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,712
Girls don't bow.
Keep your head covered.

25
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,879
Their meeting was bitter.

26
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:35,337
Her mother-in-law was a witch,

27
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,712
and her husband a total failure.

28
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:42,046
No head for business, but a great fan
of Javed-Gulzar's poetry.

29
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,962
Grandma's mother-in-law soon became
a photo frame and she - a lucky mother.

30
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:50,962
She was so obsessed with money,
that she called her son 'Tijori'.

31
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,712
Yes! My father's name means
a 'coffer'!

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,337
Grandma was scared he'd become
a poet-type like her husband.

33
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:03,504
So she kept him far away from
his father. Soshal distancing!

34
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:08,296
Lost in poetry, one day, grandpa met
with an accident.

35
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,671
Sadly the damage was permanent.

36
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:14,677
The poor man never fully recovered.

37
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:17,962
And his memory became an ebbing
and flowing thing.

38
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,837
My sweet grandpa, always living
in a dreamland.

39
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:33,129
While Dhanlakshmi Sweets became
a global brand.

40
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,546
Then the wedding band played
in our home.

41
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:38,296
Finally, grandma brought home
the family's prize possession.

42
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:40,587
That's my Mummy - Poonam.

43
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,587
Girls don't bow.
Keep your head covered.

44
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,879
Though we were selling sweet laddoos,

45
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:50,837
bitterness continued to reign supreme
in our family.

46
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,462
But I haven't told you my name.

47
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:00,358
Listen to it in the chorus lines.
It'll sound batter!

48
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,484
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

49
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,462
He's a charmer. Made in India

50
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:12,337
A real fashionista

51
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:15,504
The guy's a cool dresser

52
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:37,546
Such a heartthrob.
Such a heartthrob

53
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:40,898
Such a heartthrob.
Such a heartthrob

54
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:42,921
A hot looker!

55
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,587
What a stud!

56
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:47,337
Gurgaon's handsome Casanova

57
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,004
Look at my swag

58
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,754
I look like...

59
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:55,171
...Prada and Gucci got together
to give birth to me

60
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,337
A six-footer

61
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:01,046
Looks too good

62
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:05,064
When they look at this package

63
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:07,504
Girls can't stop winking at me

64
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,004
Such a heartthrob-ji!

65
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:15,837
Such a heartthrob-ji!

66
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,962
This guy has no match

67
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,941
Such a heartthrob-ji!

68
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:24,641
Oh my God!

69
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,587
I drink a glass of lassi every day

70
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,171
A big protein shake makes my way

71
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:49,879
If being so handsome is a crime

72
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:53,421
Then I'll happily serve jail time

73
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,462
You turn the heads of us aunties

74
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:01,046
By God! I feel a heart attack
coming on

75
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:04,796
The uncles who loved and raised you

76
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:08,629
Will soon end up divorcees

77
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:12,030
That's for sure!

78
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:15,421
You'll be the death of me

79
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:19,212
My broad chest fills
my Louis Vuitton jacket

80
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:22,629
I cruise the streets
in my Maserati

81
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:27,337
Aunties, am I for real?
Or a walkin' talkin' kebab?

82
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,921
Such a heartthrob-ji!

83
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,671
Such a heartthrob-ji!

84
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,921
This guy has no match

85
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:42,837
Oh, such a heartthrob-ji.

86
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,703
Oh my God!

87
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:48,504
Hey, Dinky, come here!
Harpreeto, come close!

88
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:57,337
A force of nature

89
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:00,754
A real rule-breaker

90
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:04,629
There's no difference to me

91
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,754
Between buds or flowers

92
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,837
Like spring

93
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,671
I embrace the whole garden

94
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:20,004
The day I get my hands on you,
I'll get even with you.

95
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,629
Such a heartthrob-ji!

96
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,129
Such a heartthrob-ji!

97
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:31,879
This guy has no match

98
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:35,087
Oh, such a heartthrob-ji

99
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,778
Oh my God!

100
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,297
The government gave me

101
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,837
a title and crowned me
'Lady Killer'

102
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,879
Such a heartthrob-ji!

103
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,546
Such a heartthrob-ji!

104
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:07,046
Oh, such a heartthrob-ji!

105
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:09,296
You moron!

106
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,837
Didn't I tell you to warn me
if they showed up?

107
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,546
Sorry! I was lost in your dance, bro.

108
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:17,587
I saw just how lost you were!
Bloody useless.

109
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:20,171
I won the award for the third time,
so I had to come.

110
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,759
What a rocking performance, Rocky!

111
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,129
- Keep it up, my boy.
- OK. See you later.

112
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,671
- What was that?
- Papa, I didn't want to dance.

113
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,842
But you know I have so many followers.

114
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,587
They kept saying, "Please, please."
So I thought it's a party...

115
00:08:35,754 --> 00:08:39,587
The day I get mad, that'll be the end
of your swagger.

116
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,004
Understand?

117
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:43,671
- Know who you are?
- Rocky.

118
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:46,087
The Dhanlakshmi Group's
future CEO.

119
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:50,296
You're not some Bollywood item dancer.
Do you get it?

120
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:55,921
- Come on.
- Welcome to the Punjabi of the Year!

121
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:04,046
Now to follow on from Rocky Randhawa's
amazing performance,

122
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:07,796
and on this wonderful occasion,
I'll a recite a verse by Firaq.

123
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,255
"The evening was filled with mist

124
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,046
"She was wistful and sad

125
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:14,629
"The evening was filled with mist

126
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,773
"She was wistful and sad

127
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,129
"Old memories stirred this heart
of mine"

128
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:21,671
Bravo! Wonderful!

129
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:28,837
Are you the full moon
or the glowing sun?

130
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:37,462
Whatever you are, I swear

131
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:40,879
You are without compare

132
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:42,504
Jamini!

133
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:48,587
For the third year,
"The Punjabi of the Year" award goes to

134
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:52,879
Dhanlakshmi Group's CEO,
Mr. Tijori Randhawa.

135
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:09,712
Her hair falls on her shoulder

136
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:13,296
like lowered clouds

137
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,546
And her eyes...

138
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:26,212
I'd like to dedicate this award
to the goddess. And another goddess...

139
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:28,962
Jamini!

140
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:32,296
My mother, Dhanlakshmi Randhawa.

141
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:37,962
Thanks to her blessings, I've won
this award for the third time.

142
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:40,046
Jamini! You've come.

143
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:42,879
- Third time winner!
- Mummy! Grandpa has gone.

144
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,546
- What?
- He's gone!

145
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:47,087
Jamini.

146
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:49,004
Jamini.

147
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:51,629
Rocky, look. Grandpa!

148
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,421
Did you come for me?

149
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,629
Oye!

150
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:02,879
What's he doing?

151
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,759
I'm so sorry, so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

152
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,462
Madam, it's the side effects
of his medicines. He gets restless.

153
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,421
Actually, it's absolutely fine.

154
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:15,921
- It happens often.
- Really?

155
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,796
Yes, I'm Mona Sen.
Kashmiri Gate.

156
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,171
Mona. We are friends!

157
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:23,254
What you doing, Grandpa?

158
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:28,087
Doctor, is it serious?

159
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:29,879
No, nothing to worry about.

160
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:33,546
I just want you to focus on his physical,
emotional and social stimulation.

161
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:36,004
Most importantly - his memory.

162
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:37,587
Jamini!

163
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,587
The name he keeps calling out...
"Jamini".

164
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:44,671
- Yes?
- I'd like you to find out who she is.

165
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:46,837
It might trigger his memory.

166
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:49,591
What trigger? He doesn't know any Jamini.

167
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:51,629
Let's go.

168
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:55,353
OK. Can you give Rocky the prescription?
Rocky...

169
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:07,879
Tijori.

170
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,546
Let's go.

171
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:14,462
This is good news.

172
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,629
Papa may be coming back
to his senses.

173
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:20,837
He was never in his right senses,
nor will he ever be.

174
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:29,671
Tijori!

175
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:30,796
What are you doing?

176
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:32,837
- You must leave for work.
- I'm coming.

177
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,546
Papa-ji...

178
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:39,845
Tijori!

179
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:49,671
When will this red colour
let go of me?

180
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,209
When?

181
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,046
What's going on, Grandpa?
You were OK.

182
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:03,588
You're switched on like a radio.
Who is this Jamini?

183
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:12,421
When will this red colour
let go of me?

184
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,587
When will this red colour

185
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,046
let go of me?

186
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:23,087
When?

187
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:26,837
When?

188
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,665
I found this in his book.

189
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:39,629
- Is she a black and white movie star?
- Looks like one.

190
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,712
- Hope she's not RIP.
- Be positive. She's grandpa's GF.

191
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,254
GF? She looks the sister-type.

192
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:50,337
Who keeps a photo of a sister-type
in their diary?

193
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,921
Jamini must be an old flame.

194
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:54,921
OK! Jai Mata Di!

195
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:57,546
Jai Mata Di! Jai Mata Di!
Jai Mata Di!

196
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,129
Shimla Coffee House.

197
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:04,087
Shimla Coffee House. 1978.

198
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:07,546
Rani Chatterjee?

199
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,254
My grandmother.

200
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,087
Her granddaughter.

201
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:20,254
Oye!

202
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:27,879
- She's a TV host.
- Yes!

203
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:30,046
She hosts an evening show.

204
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:32,645
Rani!

205
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:34,921
Golu watches her most evenings.

206
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,296
She has a catchphrase.
What is it...?

207
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:38,504
"India wants to know!"

208
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,046
Yes! India want to know!

209
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,301
Rani, Rani! I am Rani

210
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,252
The girl who knows it all

211
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:51,397
Argue and you'll look foolishly small

212
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:53,431
Do you think you can beat me?

213
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,233
Don't you know I'm the queen bee?

214
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:57,051
Do you think you can beat me?

215
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,059
Don't you know I'm the queen bee?

216
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:06,155
Queen of my dreams

217
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:13,629
Thank you.

218
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,879
How's it going, Somen?

219
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:18,629
Yes, yes, fine, fine, fine.

220
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:20,879
I'm a bit nervous. Because of you.

221
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:23,546
Today's interviewee,
he's political elite.

222
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:26,254
Don't worry. I'll be sweet to him.

223
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:28,962
Then we're done for.

224
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:31,421
Shall we go for a take?
Give me a 20 on Pradhan.

225
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:36,087
Walking to set in
3... 2... 1... go!

226
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:40,556
Real Talk with Rani

227
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:45,712
- Rani-ji. Rani-ji!
- Namaste, Pradhan-ji.

228
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:49,716
In our culture, this is how
we say "namaste".

229
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:54,754
Sure! Have a seat.

230
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,921
Of course. I haven't come here
to lie down!

231
00:15:58,504 --> 00:15:59,855
Take my phone. Switch it off.

232
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,509
The currency of our village
runs through foreign lands

233
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,121
Everyone steps aside
when the lads arrive

234
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,528
Tall and broad, the lads
drip with attitude

235
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,823
I am a lover of the beauty of spring

236
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:15,212
Sir, sir! Parking is in the basement.

237
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:17,879
And Shah Rukh's at home in Mannat.

238
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,712
The car stays here.

239
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:23,046
One scratch and my punch will make
breaking news.

240
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,129
Here.

241
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:25,171
Prasad.

242
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:28,337
My Ferrari adds value to your building.

243
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,337
So, Pradhan-ji,

244
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,296
- your constituency is Vasalay?
- Yes.

245
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:37,772
You didn't make any statement
about the recent rape case?

246
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:39,921
What kind of question is that,
Rani-ji?

247
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:44,879
Why would I make a statement
about such a trivial incident?

248
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,504
- A trivial incident?
- What else?

249
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:51,539
Today's girls are addicted
to junk food,

250
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,373
so such incidents are natural.

251
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:56,498
If you open a box of sweets,
flies are bound to gather.

252
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,581
Do you get me?

253
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:02,706
Girls should know what clothes
to wear, and what not to.

254
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:10,373
And when a two-year-child or an old lady
gets raped?

255
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,914
You misunderstood what I was trying
to say, Rani-ji.

256
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,706
Think what men go through.

257
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:24,748
They work all day, the tension,
the frustration, so they will...

258
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,956
I'm sorry, but you know
what's really frustrating?

259
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,271
That people like you get elected.

260
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:35,594
I'll tell you why rape...

261
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:37,481
Rani! Enough, enough, enough.

262
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:41,283
Because nasty men like you
are around.

263
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,158
The problem isn't our clothes,
or what we eat,

264
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:45,491
it's your dirty minds.

265
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:49,116
You compared women to a box of sweets,
didn't you?

266
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:53,033
Pradhan-ji, the day you stop
objectifying us,

267
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:57,324
perhaps then we'll no longer hear
of such distressing incidents.

268
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,908
Your minds are dirty and we're
supposed to cover ourselves?

269
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:03,866
What kind of justice is that?

270
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:10,616
Stop your damn camera!

271
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:12,491
Get my car!

272
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:16,616
Why invite me here only to insult me?

273
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:19,762
I had to invite you, Pradhan-ji.

274
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:22,585
To teach you about our culture.

275
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,788
Rani, Rani! I am Rani

276
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:25,787
Namaste.

277
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:27,699
Get my car!

278
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:29,491
Let's go.

279
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:34,116
Rani! You'll get us taken off air.

280
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,824
You be quiet!

281
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:38,991
- Rani, you're incorrigible!
- I know that.

282
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:41,570
OK, Somen!
There's a board meeting at 5.

283
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,991
- Madam-ji, madam...
- Yes, what is it?

284
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,783
- Have you taken out a loan?
- A loan?

285
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,949
Two debt collectors are here.

286
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:52,556
The currency of our village
runs through foreign lands

287
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,792
Everyone steps aside
when the lads arrive

288
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,824
What's going on in the country?

289
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,783
I am a lover of the beauty of spring

290
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:04,949
Hello.

291
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:06,158
Yes?

292
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:09,411
Yes?

293
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:13,074
Nothing really... I was saying...
He's Vicky. My BFF-cum-trainer.

294
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,181
Soon to marry steady girlfriend
Minty.

295
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,408
Congratulations!

296
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:21,741
Minty is a lucky girl.

297
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,241
And you are?

298
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,699
Single.

299
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,699
Lucky for you.

300
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,199
Rocky Randhawa this side.

301
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,783
And if you come this side,
who will you be?

302
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:36,616
Meanz?

303
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:37,991
Nothing.

304
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:44,533
Shits! You're checking me out?

305
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:47,658
No, sorry...

306
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:50,471
Do you always wear your shirt
wide open?

307
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:53,283
Always. Low is good,
Lower is batter.

308
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:56,320
Don't mind, but if I said anything
about your neckline,

309
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,857
or commented on your blouse,
all hell would break loose!

310
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,065
Sorry. I didn't mean
to objectify you. I just...

311
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,565
No objection taken!
I'm made to admire.

312
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,440
A ton of hard work.
All natural, no steroid! Aks him.

313
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,440
Sit down.

314
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:12,190
What will you have?
Tea or coffee, or...?

315
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:15,148
One espresso shot before workout,
now protein time.

316
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,607
Rani-ji, my card. Here.

317
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:21,357
Twenty-two karat gold plated.

318
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:25,607
Anyway, full intro. We have a shop
in Karol Bagh market.

319
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,148
First shop, biggest shop, our shop -
Dhanlakshmi Sweets.

320
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,440
You must've heard the name?
It's as famous as "Rahul"!

321
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,773
I wouldn't say we're the biggest,
we are the biggest!

322
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:39,485
We don't have attitude
like South Delhi-ites.

323
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,148
For rum: Bold Monk.
For vodka: Simrin-pop.

324
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,523
Full ground to earth!

325
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,565
That's lovely... what did you want?

326
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,565
- Is Jamini Chatter your granny?
- Chatterjee.

327
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:54,565
You added the 'Jee' to Chatter?

328
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,190
No. It's Jamini 'Chatterjee'.
It's a Bengali surname.

329
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:00,523
To answer your question,
yes, she's my granny.

330
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:01,982
Yes!

331
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,732
Tell me, Rani-ji, is your granny
dead or alive?

332
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,065
Dead?

333
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:11,023
Sorry. When?

334
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:13,523
No, shut up! She's alive.

335
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,523
Alive? That's good news.
So why say "shut up"?

336
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:22,190
Can you confirm this is your granny?

337
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,690
That's Thakuma.

338
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,190
My grandpa, Kanwal.

339
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,857
He has bad health problems
and a failing memory.

340
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:37,523
He cannot walk or talk,
but suddenly two days ago,

341
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:41,898
he said: "Jamini" and gave
some pretty lady a kiss.

342
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,023
Then I found a photo of your granny
in his poetry diary.

343
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,107
"Jamini" is written on the back.

344
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:53,273
It seemed fishy to me.

345
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,065
Krezzy, no?

346
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:57,065
Crazy.

347
00:21:57,341 --> 00:22:00,778
Rani-ji, I love my grandpa
the most in this whole world.

348
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:02,523
I just want him to be OK.

349
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,815
Our doctor said this "Jamini"

350
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,815
may help with his memory.
She called it...?

351
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:10,273
A trigger.

352
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:14,023
So I thought if grandpa met her,

353
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,232
his old memories would be revived.

354
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:20,857
And he'd remember us again.

355
00:22:21,316 --> 00:22:21,857
OK.

356
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:28,065
That's all. Can you show the photo
to your granny and call me?

357
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,190
Facetime. 24/7.
For you - avaylable.

358
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:33,815
OK.

359
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,107
- Bye.
- Bye.

360
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,190
Lund.

361
00:22:42,732 --> 00:22:45,482
- What!
- Kanwal Lund. Grandpa's name.

362
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,815
- For granny to remember!
- OK.

363
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:49,190
OK.

364
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,148
- Bye.
- Bye.

365
00:22:58,342 --> 00:22:59,648
Oh my God!

366
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,898
- Share the joke?
- Oh God, Somen.

367
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,607
You scared me!

368
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,695
- Guess what?
- What?

369
00:23:09,815 --> 00:23:12,773
I have two tickets
for a jazz performance.

370
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:15,190
Piano-man? Two tickets.

371
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:17,462
Great, who you going with?

372
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,419
This is my grandfather's
ancestral home.

373
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:33,156
Grandfather has passed away, but
he's still remembered with great respect.

374
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,783
My mother, Anjoli Ray Chatterjee.

375
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:40,296
Delhi University's most senior
English Literature professor.

376
00:23:40,826 --> 00:23:42,402
All I can say is -

377
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:45,010
the British have gone, but they
left her behind!

378
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:48,900
Ah, the prodigal daughter returns!

379
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,992
Hi, Ma.

380
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:52,801
Well, this isn't a boastful
rodomontade.

381
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:55,791
But, darling, I had envisaged
quite correctly so

382
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,901
that you'd be rather tardy
in reaching home this evening.

383
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,879
Our in-house Shashi Tharoor.

384
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:06,049
She means: 'I assumed you'd be late.'

385
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:07,890
Is father's class on?

386
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:13,566
My Baba - The best father in the world.
Chandon Chatterjee.

387
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,533
He used to be quite a famous Kathak
dancer in Kolkata.

388
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:21,313
But Ma got a terrific job in Delhi,
so he moved here with her.

389
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:24,450
Things aren't the same for him
as they were in Kolkata.

390
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:26,522
He teaches dance at home now.

391
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,855
He never complains, but I know
he really misses his stage.

392
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:37,063
And this is Jamini. My granny.

393
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:40,254
She loves poetry and old Hindi
film songs.

394
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:41,522
Thakuma!

395
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,688
Sweetie!

396
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:46,587
Dinner nearly ready?

397
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,865
Enough salt?

398
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,990
Delicious!

399
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:55,208
Esh! Freshen up first.
Silly girl!

400
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,208
- Rani.
- Yes?

401
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,708
I spoke to Somen.

402
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,875
He offered you two concert tickets.

403
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,708
And you declined without
as much as a confabulation?

404
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,750
You really keep tabs on Somen.
Why not marry him?

405
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:14,500
If I was your age, I would!

406
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:17,208
I positively bombilate with anticipation

407
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,042
every time I see the two of them
together.

408
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,042
Seriously, Ma, think of it.
Somen weds Rani.

409
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,750
Somen weds Rani!
Think about it.

410
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:27,851
God forbid. Rani did give it a try.
But what happened?

411
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:30,333
- They broke up within three months.
- Ah! So what?

412
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:33,250
And on top of everything else,
that fool was a bad lover.

413
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,875
Ask Rani. Tell her!

414
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,917
Actually, the boys of today,
they lack rhythm.

415
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:42,000
What do girls want? Rhythm!
See?

416
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,670
And boys go thump thump thump!

417
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:51,708
- Chandon!
- Baba is right, Ma.

418
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:55,167
There's zero chemistry between
Somen and me.

419
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,375
The problem is we look for chemistry
where it's not to be found.

420
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,375
You find it where you least expect it.

421
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:08,625
Love hits you like a storm, and you get
swept away like a tiny twig.

422
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:14,208
Speaking of storms. A real storm
swept through my office today.

423
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:17,161
If only you had seen him.
A real museum piece.

424
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:21,708
He asked me to ask granny about...
what was his name?

425
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,583
Kanwal Lund?

426
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:27,458
I think that was the name.

427
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:31,042
Huh?

428
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,458
What's wrong?

429
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,125
Sometimes fleeting moments

430
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,583
give you enough love
for a lifetime.

431
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:01,917
I can never forget that week.

432
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:09,917
In 1978,

433
00:27:10,518 --> 00:27:15,167
I went with my sister Nandini
to Shimla for a holiday.

434
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:20,500
That's where I met Kanwal-ji.

435
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:23,708
At a poetry symposium.

436
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:27,583
When we heard a couplet by Firaq,

437
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:34,875
we both said "splendid"
at the same time.

438
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,583
It was like

439
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:43,083
I had met a soulmate
for the first time.

440
00:27:46,813 --> 00:27:52,250
At first, we became close friends.
Then friendship turned into love.

441
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:55,875
We were both married,

442
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,917
and didn't have the courage
to break our homes.

443
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:03,833
So one day,

444
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:07,583
we both

445
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,333
made the decision to part.

446
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:17,750
That's all I have left.

447
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:41,667
So I just got my PR this year
and like...

448
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:44,625
Ah, here comes the tea.
And Golu too.

449
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,542
Namaste.

450
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:51,583
She doesn't look a bit like
her photograph.

451
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:57,375
You didn't send a full-length photo.
She's a little...

452
00:28:58,123 --> 00:29:01,167
Do have some tea. And try our
special Dhanlakshmi laddoos.

453
00:29:01,338 --> 00:29:02,250
Serve everyone, dear.

454
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:03,750
How many sugars?

455
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:06,250
I'm on like a sugarless diet.

456
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,500
You have Stevia? Sugar free?

457
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:13,833
There you go.

458
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:19,012
- And how many sugars for you?
- Thanks.

459
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:22,804
I'm on a diet.
Shall I send you the details?

460
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:26,096
Diet? Diet!

461
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:29,346
Everyone in our family is super healthy.

462
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:35,096
Our Shonty is a fitness freak.
Hiking-wiking, Tai Chi.

463
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:37,054
You too?

464
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:40,512
- Exercise?
- Excuse me?

465
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:43,137
It's OK if they don't share
the same hobbies,

466
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:46,221
but their hearts must match.
Personalities must match.

467
00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:48,179
Ask Gayatri anything you want.

468
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:49,262
Shonty!

469
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:54,637
Fine. So, like, does marrying within
like the community matter to you?

470
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:56,179
Answer.

471
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:01,179
As mother said, hearts matching
is more important.

472
00:30:01,387 --> 00:30:02,971
I have nothing against intercourse.

473
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,971
We must do it. It's important
for the community...

474
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:10,054
Not intercourse, inter-caste!

475
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:11,929
She meanz inter-caste.

476
00:30:12,054 --> 00:30:14,012
Auto-krect problem.

477
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:18,387
She gets her words in a twist.
But never confuses numbers.

478
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:20,679
Sister is a state topper in mathematiz!

479
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:23,073
They want a bride, not an accountant.

480
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,221
Have your tea.

481
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:27,012
There's little else anyway.

482
00:30:27,304 --> 00:30:30,721
- She's funny...
- Funny?

483
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,387
- Forget it! He was too short.
- Just leave me alone.

484
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:39,512
If your words come out wrong,
then stay silent. Get it?

485
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:41,846
But I won't stay silent.

486
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:44,137
She's been rejected 50 times.

487
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:47,804
But she's sworn never to lose weight.

488
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,429
- Who does she take after?
- Who do you think?

489
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:52,221
Oh!

490
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,012
Don't worry, sis.

491
00:30:57,637 --> 00:31:00,637
I'll help you. From tomorrow
no cheato, only Keto.

492
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:03,346
Get lost! Did I ask you to help?
Big talker!

493
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:05,346
See how she answers back?

494
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:08,137
Forget it. Do I care!

495
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:16,762
Have you verified these numbers?
Are you sure?

496
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:19,554
Rocky, hurry up. We're getting late.

497
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,929
Bro, I must work sometimes.
Officyal signaytures.

498
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:24,387
Hello, Rocky Randhawa this side.

499
00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:25,387
Hello?

500
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:27,721
This is Rani...

501
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,846
Rani Chatterjee.

502
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:34,471
Is the fire burning on both sides?

503
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:36,429
Excuse me?

504
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:38,804
I was talking about Kanwal
and Jamini.

505
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:40,471
I see.

506
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:42,137
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

507
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:44,387
Or were you thinking about us?

508
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,637
Why? You in-trusted?

509
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:50,750
Depends. Try a pick-up line.

510
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,512
OK! I'm a pupy, take me home.

511
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:57,429
Puppy?

512
00:31:57,554 --> 00:32:00,137
Prospruss Urban Punjabi Youth.
Pupy!

513
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:05,096
You really are unique!

514
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:07,262
Glad you're so informal.

515
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:08,887
Listen, I need to see you.

516
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,262
Know the wrestlers' arena
in Roshanara Park? Come there.

517
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:16,971
A wrestlers' arena?
Not a coffee shop?

518
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:19,596
Remember my BFF cum-trainer, Vicky?

519
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:20,929
Yes, Vicky.

520
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:22,679
We'll meet at his grandpa's arena.

521
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:26,429
They're sallibrating a golden jubilee.
See you there.

522
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:29,012
You go ahead. We can meet tomorrow.

523
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:31,887
Must you always argue?
"Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo."

524
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:33,804
Sending you the location pin.
See you at 4.

525
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:35,346
See you there. OK, bye!

526
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:41,762
Why are you smiling?

527
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:44,240
Good afternoon everyone!

528
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,516
Welcome to today's entertaining
wrestling tournament!

529
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:50,925
Let's have a round of applause
for today's wrestlers.

530
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,679
Hello, Rani-ji!

531
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:57,512
Valcome! Valcome to Akhada-mela collab!

532
00:32:57,929 --> 00:32:59,429
- Look naice.
- Thank you.

533
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:01,762
I see. You brought your brother
for your safety!

534
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,346
Rani-ji, don't go by my looks,
we are a good nature!

535
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:07,596
- I'm her colleague.
- Yeah.

536
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:09,221
Colleague?

537
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:11,721
Mother's side? Father's side?

538
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:13,887
He works with me.

539
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:16,679
Bro!

540
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:18,971
Somen... Rocky.
Rocky... Somen.

541
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:22,637
And bro, I can look after my safety
just fine.

542
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:25,679
Taek-won. Whoa!

543
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:27,971
Bring it here!

544
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:31,429
This is the best lassi in the whole
of Old Delhi.

545
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:35,262
- The best!
- Washing machine special. Cheers!

546
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:38,137
We boys call our WhatsApp group:

547
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:41,471
"Drinks lassi, trapped she is."
Essclusive guys talk only.

548
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,137
OK.

549
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:45,346
Don't think Rani-ji is going
to drink that lassi.

550
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:49,179
Delicate South Delhi-ite.

551
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,429
What were you saying?

552
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:04,804
You got the...

553
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:07,512
What?

554
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:10,221
What?

555
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,221
Think we're done. Let's go, please.
Thank you.

556
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:25,012
I want to talk to him. One second.

557
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:27,804
I want to talk to you.

558
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,512
- Private?
- Ya.

559
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,971
Keep busy. Come side.

560
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:40,012
- No, no, bro. Where you going?
- Yes, Rani-ji... tell me.

561
00:34:40,554 --> 00:34:41,971
I spoke to my granny.

562
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:45,137
And she wants to meet your grandpa.

563
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:49,096
Bullseye!

564
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:56,971
OK.

565
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,971
Bring your grandpa
over to our house.

566
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:03,096
No way. Grandma has grandpa
in lockdown.

567
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:05,096
He's under house arrest.

568
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:08,221
Can't blame her. When he goes out,
he's out of control.

569
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:09,762
Izz a bad scene.

570
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,429
OK, no worries.
We'll come to your place.

571
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:14,554
Sure.

572
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:17,929
Rocky!

573
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:21,762
Valcome! Come.

574
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:23,012
Done!

575
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,512
- OK.
- But tell me.

576
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:29,429
You could've asked me
on the phone.

577
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,012
I could've.

578
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,971
But how else to check you out?

579
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:39,512
I'm melting!

580
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,804
- I had better go.
- Where going?

581
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:46,304
Wait! My programme is about to start.

582
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:48,304
- Dance party.
- You're gonna dance?

583
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:53,679
I can't see any rhythm
in your body.

584
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:55,804
Esscuse!

585
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:58,471
Challenge?

586
00:35:59,262 --> 00:35:59,929
Yeah!

587
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:02,262
Come. Let me show you.

588
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:10,304
Pretty lady. Pretty lady

589
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:12,684
Can't take my eyes off you

590
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,637
Pretty lady. Pretty lady

591
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,012
Can't take my eyes off you

592
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,406
Pretty lady. Pretty lady

593
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,554
You're in the Rai Bareilly marketplace

594
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:25,054
Flaunting your beauty

595
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:29,300
She'll take your breath away
when your eyes meet

596
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:32,679
Pretty lady. Pretty lady

597
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:36,804
You're in the Rai Bareilly marketplace

598
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,804
Flaunting your beauty

599
00:36:39,471 --> 00:36:42,478
She'll take your breath away
when your eyes meet

600
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:45,719
Decked in jewellery from head to toe

601
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,012
Watch out for the gust of wind

602
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:51,929
Your earring may fly off,
so don't say, 'Where's it gone?'

603
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:55,733
Your earring! Oh no!

604
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,318
What earring?

605
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:02,025
What earring?

606
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:06,407
What earring?

607
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,253
Oh no!

608
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:14,920
What earring?

609
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:17,962
Pretty lady. Pretty lady

610
00:37:18,341 --> 00:37:19,358
Can't take my eyes off you

611
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:21,645
Pretty lady. Pretty lady

612
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:25,698
So innocent on the outside

613
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:27,948
So fake on the inside

614
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:31,407
Why are you after me, you flirt?

615
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:36,448
Stuck like sellotape.
Pasted on like glue

616
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,782
A good-for-nothing.
You're a right fool

617
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:45,282
You're just looking for the chance
to hit a homerun

618
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:49,365
In case you find a missing earring

619
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:50,479
What earring?

620
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,744
Your earring did fall off!

621
00:37:58,532 --> 00:37:59,490
What earring?

622
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:08,245
What earring?

623
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:11,532
Your earring did fall off!

624
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,256
Your earring fell off in the
Bareilly marketplace

625
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:52,683
Your earring fell off in the
Bareilly marketplace

626
00:38:52,803 --> 00:38:55,217
Your earring did fall off!

627
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,865
How long have you known
my husband?

628
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:21,532
We met in 1978
at a poetry symposium.

629
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:23,740
You write poetry?

630
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:26,323
Oh no. I just like poetry.

631
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,907
And your husband?

632
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:33,490
He has passed away.

633
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:37,073
How many times did you meet
my husband?

634
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:40,407
About five or six times.

635
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:41,823
Five or six times?

636
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:45,365
Hear that? They met 5 or 6 times,
yet he keeps calling her name.

637
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:49,990
My husband.

638
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:20,157
Kanwal-ji... how are you?

639
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:22,490
My husband.

640
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:23,990
Yes.

641
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,448
I'm Jamini.

642
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:33,157
Shimla Coffee House.

643
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,073
The poetry symposium?

644
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:37,365
The Firaq verse:

645
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:41,032
"The evening was filled with mist

646
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:44,240
"She was wistful and sad

647
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,990
"Old memories stirred this heart
of mine"

648
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,823
We went on walks.

649
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:59,907
We saw a rerun of 'Hum Dono'
at the Gaiety cinema.

650
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,823
Our favourite old song...

651
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:18,657
It's time for father to have
his medicine.

652
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,679
Thank you for your valuable time.

653
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:26,532
Ma, let's go.

654
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:37,942
Jamini!

655
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:52,065
Don't go away, don't leave me now

656
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:58,198
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

657
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:07,198
Don't go away, don't leave me now

658
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:10,990
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

659
00:42:17,698 --> 00:42:20,865
You have only just arrived

660
00:42:21,615 --> 00:42:24,657
Blossoming like the spring

661
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:28,990
Let the air spread your fragrance

662
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:32,782
Let us exchange a glance or two

663
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:36,990
Let the evening settle into night

664
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:44,948
Let the evening settle into night

665
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:48,698
Let my heart recover itself

666
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,698
Let me live this precious moment

667
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:56,657
Let me drink of this sweet nectar

668
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,441
Let me drink of this sweet nectar

669
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:04,365
You've hardly said a word

670
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:08,240
You've hardly heard me say much

671
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:12,282
Don't be offended by what I say

672
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:16,532
This is love and not a complaint

673
00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:20,240
Don't leave me now.

674
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:22,782
My heart hasn't had its fill of you.

675
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,218
Bro, can I say something?

676
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,260
Grandpa turned out like the kisser
Emraan Hashmi, but for old folk.

677
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:34,927
He has such strong emotions
even now, he's just...

678
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:38,510
You're fokusing on his love story,
what about me?

679
00:43:38,718 --> 00:43:39,677
Go to hell!

680
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,343
Rani Chatterjee is so classy,
bet she even sneezes in English.

681
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,760
So what! Aren't I aejucated too?

682
00:43:47,193 --> 00:43:49,346
Didn't Papa buy me a top place
in 12th class?

683
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:52,635
- Oh wow! You're aejucated, bro!
- Legit, bro!

684
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,135
Just because you read the label on
a protein box doesn't make you educated.

685
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,807
- Oh, hello.
- Silly boy.

686
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,635
Didn't grandpa floor Jamini Chatter?
All in the genes, bro!

687
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,260
But grandpa knows poetry.

688
00:44:06,302 --> 00:44:07,468
Do you?

689
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,052
Piping hot fish! Any takers?

690
00:44:15,177 --> 00:44:17,385
Ah! Culinary genius.

691
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,218
Thank you, Ma.

692
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:21,260
Ma?

693
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:24,510
Cool. I've always wanted
a little brother.

694
00:44:24,635 --> 00:44:25,510
Hey!

695
00:44:26,552 --> 00:44:28,432
Hello to the Chatterjees!

696
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:30,343
You're having a party
and didn't invite me.

697
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,843
Sonam, you're like Rani's network.

698
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:36,218
Where she, there you.
So clingy!

699
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:37,218
Ma!

700
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:41,385
Rocky, might I entice you
with a drink?

701
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,927
- Can you repeat?
- Entice?

702
00:44:46,093 --> 00:44:46,968
Drink?

703
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:47,885
Sure!

704
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,218
You are take-ing?

705
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:52,385
I also take-ing.

706
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:56,677
We are all... take-ing.
For you, ice or water?

707
00:44:56,885 --> 00:44:58,468
On zee rocks!

708
00:44:58,718 --> 00:45:00,260
I'll get you on the rocks.

709
00:45:03,427 --> 00:45:05,635
Hi, Rani. How's you?

710
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:07,302
I'm fine.

711
00:45:07,802 --> 00:45:10,552
You here to deliver laddoos?

712
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,218
Grandma says never go anywhere
empty-handed.

713
00:45:14,718 --> 00:45:17,135
This is just a small...
Put it inside.

714
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:20,385
Actually, I wanted to talk.

715
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,968
Go ahead!

716
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:23,885
Come to side.

717
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:26,052
Yes, let's go.

718
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:28,510
OK?

719
00:45:31,677 --> 00:45:34,385
Let's go where there's no network.

720
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:36,343
Oh... Somen.

721
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:40,927
If you need me,

722
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:43,552
just give me a call.

723
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:46,968
You're right here. Why should I call?

724
00:45:47,346 --> 00:45:48,593
Yes. Correct.

725
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:52,260
Not "Sonam". It's Somen!

726
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:54,885
OK!

727
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,093
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

728
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:05,177
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

729
00:46:05,718 --> 00:46:06,802
Speak up!

730
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,218
"In 1978,

731
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,260
"a love story was incomplete

732
00:46:18,302 --> 00:46:19,302
OK.

733
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,135
"In 2022,

734
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:24,843
"they just had to meet.

735
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:31,552
"So grandpa could get back
his mammery.

736
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:37,635
"Rani is as sveet as jaggery!"

737
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,593
Jaggery?

738
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,843
I couldn't find another rhyme
for "mammery." So "jaggery".

739
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,260
You really are unique!

740
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:50,968
Unique?

741
00:46:58,302 --> 00:47:01,302
Coming back to "they just had
to meet."

742
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,302
- There's one problem.
- What?

743
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,927
What about your grandma
and your dad?

744
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:08,552
What?

745
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:14,510
What they don't know, won't hurt them!
Simpal!

746
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:19,177
But where will my granny and your
grandpa meet? I mean...

747
00:47:19,297 --> 00:47:22,718
Seriously? No better place for lovers
than Delhi.

748
00:47:23,406 --> 00:47:24,468
That's true.

749
00:47:24,593 --> 00:47:29,802
They will meet... but on the sly.

750
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:32,260
Know vot I meanz?

751
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:34,177
I know what you meanz.

752
00:47:34,343 --> 00:47:37,302
Come, let us do back party join.

753
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:38,718
OK.

754
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:53,921
A time capsule of memories.

755
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,678
Riding on the wind,
floating with the clouds

756
00:47:58,012 --> 00:47:58,720
Careful!

757
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:02,512
Riding on the wind,
floating with the clouds

758
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:05,345
Darling, let's fly

759
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,970
Take me along with you,
every day and night

760
00:48:10,428 --> 00:48:14,512
Careful, come with me.
Hand-in-hand, we go

761
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:16,762
Darling, let's fly

762
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:37,387
This intoxicating evening

763
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:41,637
Makes my head spin

764
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:48,262
I can feel myself being pulled
towards you

765
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:53,595
This intoxicating evening

766
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:57,637
Makes my head spin

767
00:48:58,178 --> 00:49:03,678
I can feel myself being pulled
towards you

768
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,628
How are you, my dear?

769
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:09,470
What's on your mind?

770
00:49:09,925 --> 00:49:13,236
You got all stirred up, oh ho ho...

771
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,920
And slipped away just like that,
aa aa aa...

772
00:49:17,362 --> 00:49:20,518
Where do we slip off to next?

773
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,582
I'm sending a pin, be careful,
don't get pricked.

774
00:49:35,357 --> 00:49:39,470
The weather can't be trusted today

775
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,428
The weather today

776
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:52,178
There's a storm on its way

777
00:49:57,177 --> 00:50:01,030
The weather is stormy today

778
00:50:02,827 --> 00:50:06,887
The weather can't be trusted today

779
00:50:10,803 --> 00:50:12,803
The weather today

780
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:21,845
Gain something, lose something

781
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:27,345
Lose something, gain something

782
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:35,762
Life is full of meetings
and partings.

783
00:50:38,387 --> 00:50:42,178
I always wondered why granny loved
these old film songs.

784
00:50:42,595 --> 00:50:46,595
Now I get it. She loved the memories
associated with them.

785
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:53,970
Life has no meaning without
our love story

786
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,345
Our love song

787
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:21,553
Love? No, I'm not in love with him,
Granny.

788
00:51:23,095 --> 00:51:26,970
Me and Rocky - it's just a fling.
It's just a thing.

789
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,053
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

790
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:36,845
Are you scared?

791
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,262
Absolutely not. You're overreacting.

792
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:43,095
Why are you ignoring your feelings?

793
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:47,720
Look, my sweetie, you and I
are so alike.

794
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:51,012
You are a part of me.

795
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,387
And for us nothing is ever
just a fling.

796
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,012
Just a thing.

797
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,887
- When you think about love...
- It's not love, Thakuma.

798
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:02,428
Everything is permitted in love.

799
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,220
Just think before you act.

800
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:13,512
You may hold the steering wheel
of relationships in your hand,

801
00:52:14,637 --> 00:52:17,928
but it's family that does
the backseat driving.

802
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:23,762
I mean both our families.

803
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,887
Good night.

804
00:52:29,553 --> 00:52:30,678
Good night.

805
00:52:37,512 --> 00:52:38,928
It's not love.

806
00:52:41,387 --> 00:52:42,387
What time tomorrow?

807
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:46,637
Not tomorrow, the day after.
Tomorrow's my birthday.

808
00:52:46,845 --> 00:52:47,637
Burrday?

809
00:52:48,387 --> 00:52:50,178
That calls for a spashal sallibration.

810
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:52,220
No way! No celebrations.

811
00:52:52,345 --> 00:52:54,803
I hate cakes, parties - everything.

812
00:52:55,012 --> 00:52:57,220
In fact, I prefer working
on my birthday.

813
00:52:57,428 --> 00:53:00,220
A burrday is the best day.
Can I give you a gift?

814
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:02,053
Day after tomorrow.

815
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,887
Oh no, naughty Chatterjee!

816
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:06,887
That gift is my duty!

817
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:09,600
What else can I give you?
Gucci? LV?

818
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,803
No, siree. Your choice won't do.
Let's meet the day after.

819
00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:15,137
What's wrong with my choice?

820
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:21,428
A party is a must for you, Miss Chatterjee.
Vait and vatch!

821
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:25,012
- So Rani, what birthday plans?
- None. You know me.

822
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:31,637
Come on, baby. Sit in my car

823
00:53:32,203 --> 00:53:36,034
Come on, baby. Sit in my car

824
00:53:37,428 --> 00:53:41,053
We'll go on a long drive, full speed.
Stopping nowhere.

825
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,053
- Didn't I tell you?
- Come on!

826
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,095
- Go away.
- Please.

827
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,303
- No.
- Yes.

828
00:53:50,262 --> 00:53:51,637
Let's go.

829
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,928
Sweetie, where to?

830
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:02,762
- Where?
- Right here.

831
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,928
Why have we come to this junk shop?

832
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:08,178
No patience at all.

833
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:10,178
- Right. Take right.
- OK.

834
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:12,262
Now?

835
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:13,762
Rocky?

836
00:54:14,942 --> 00:54:15,803
Rocky?

837
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:22,137
Rocky?

838
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,845
Hallos and valcomes.

839
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:33,512
Vintaege vibes.

840
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:43,262
Listen! Miss Chatterjee,
my heart's matter-jee

841
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:47,970
The Calcutta girl is mad at me

842
00:54:48,387 --> 00:54:50,553
Gotta make it better-jee.

843
00:54:50,724 --> 00:54:52,303
B-e-t-t-e-r!

844
00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:57,399
B-e-t-t-e-r!

845
00:54:59,615 --> 00:55:01,723
Listen! Miss Chatterjee

846
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:03,997
My heart's matter-jee

847
00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:08,012
The Calcutta girl is mad at me

848
00:55:08,536 --> 00:55:10,672
Gotta make it better-jee.

849
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:13,088
B-e-t-t-e-r!

850
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,426
B-e-t-t-e-r!

851
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:24,220
- Rocky, what's all this?
- I know you liking old Hindi songs.

852
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:28,053
Your lover listened to many songs
to find one with your name!

853
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:29,600
'It's Rani's birthday.'

854
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,678
I know, Alexa, thank you very much!

855
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:36,387
I aalso know you don't like cakes,

856
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:39,678
but you can't have something
against laddoos.

857
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:43,845
Cakes have refined sugar,
and these have Indian ghee.

858
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,387
So haalth benefits!

859
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:48,720
Come over here and cut the laddoo.
Make a wish!

860
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:52,095
May Rocky's hotness and cuteness
be everlasting!

861
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,262
May his body-fat stay
in single digits.

862
00:55:54,387 --> 00:55:55,532
A Chanel bag...

863
00:55:59,762 --> 00:56:01,018
Happy Burrday!

864
00:56:01,553 --> 00:56:04,679
Have a little. Don't get fat,
even if it's your burrdday.

865
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:12,137
Many happy returns of the day.

866
00:56:12,356 --> 00:56:13,345
Thank you.

867
00:56:35,678 --> 00:56:39,512
I was thinking like
this is a-spacious day.

868
00:56:41,012 --> 00:56:43,970
So let's go all the way.
Make it a bigger day.

869
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:45,428
Rocky, I must go home.

870
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:46,970
What's wrong?

871
00:56:47,095 --> 00:56:49,637
It's nothing. It's...

872
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:52,595
Thank you, it's lovely.

873
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:55,553
But I must get home.
My family's waiting for me.

874
00:56:55,845 --> 00:57:00,137
Yes, you must be with the family
on your burrday.

875
00:57:00,345 --> 00:57:02,303
It's all about loving your family.

876
00:57:02,512 --> 00:57:04,303
Yeah, it's all about the family.

877
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:08,517
- Will you drop me home?
- Of course.

878
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:10,637
- Huh? I'll...
- Yeah.

879
00:57:22,637 --> 00:57:26,428
The NGO in Kashmir has agreed.
When do you want to go?

880
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:27,887
Rani!

881
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,345
- Rani!
- Rocky!

882
00:57:31,303 --> 00:57:33,803
Somen! I'm sorry. I-I heard you!

883
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:41,678
Guys, can we please take?
I gotta go. Yeah?

884
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:44,053
All right, guys, let's go for a take.

885
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:48,471
Thakuma and your grandfather are sitting
in the garden. They're singing loudly.

886
00:57:49,044 --> 00:57:49,720
Where are you?

887
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:53,428
Rocky?

888
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,720
Rocky, what is all this?

889
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:05,178
Come on, Rocky. Stop it.
Where are you?

890
00:58:09,262 --> 00:58:10,428
Hi, babez.

891
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:11,887
Valcome!

892
00:58:13,592 --> 00:58:15,303
To garden of the galaxy!

893
00:58:19,178 --> 00:58:21,053
I know you were feeling awks
yesterday.

894
00:58:21,428 --> 00:58:22,970
Everything was low-key.

895
00:58:23,552 --> 00:58:24,887
Then I realised,

896
00:58:25,928 --> 00:58:30,637
to sweep Rani off her feet, we need
big canvas moviemaker Rajamouli.

897
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:32,303
Rocky, you don't -

898
00:58:36,678 --> 00:58:39,678
Today was legs day.
But I skipped it.

899
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:42,637
So I can go down on my knees.

900
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:45,887
Rocky, please! Don't do that.

901
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:50,803
We love one another. So marriage
is the natural next stap, no?

902
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:53,928
OK, Rocky, slow down.

903
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:57,637
Whatever's happening between us...
I'm having a lot of fun.

904
00:58:57,762 --> 00:59:00,026
But it's not a love story,

905
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,970
it's a lust story.
It's just physical, that's it.

906
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,345
Just a physical... nothing emotional?

907
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:11,512
Emotional? How, Rocky?

908
00:59:11,887 --> 00:59:15,637
We've only just met.
Do you really know me?

909
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,262
We should understand each other's
feelings, thoughts.

910
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:23,428
What about politics, social reform,
defence, education?

911
00:59:23,548 --> 00:59:26,845
- Do you have an opinion about anything?
- Have you ever asked me?

912
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:31,142
The problem is you think I'm a duffer.
Ask me something.

913
00:59:31,262 --> 00:59:33,678
I'll outwit Google,
or my name isn't Rocky.

914
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:35,428
- Rocky, let it drop.
- Ask!

915
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:36,887
- No...
- Today you must.

916
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:38,678
I don't want to take an IQ test,
Rocky.

917
00:59:38,803 --> 00:59:40,095
Ask me a question.

918
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,600
- Let it go!
- Ask!

919
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,803
Where in India is West Bengal?

920
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:45,178
In the West. But obvio...

921
00:59:45,803 --> 00:59:48,220
- The East!
- A trick question.

922
00:59:48,558 --> 00:59:50,512
- Another one.
- Rocky, never mind.

923
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:52,637
Rani, do you think
you're the only aedjucated one?

924
00:59:52,762 --> 00:59:55,262
- Who is India's President?
- Dr. Rajendra Prasad.

925
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,845
Droupadi Murmu.

926
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,762
Rajendra Prasad was our
first president, Rocky.

927
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,720
You didn't spacify! First or last.

928
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:03,053
Are you serious? You're talking
like a kid now.

929
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,095
Rocky, the point is we're very different.

930
01:00:05,303 --> 01:00:08,095
And more importantly, our families
are very different.

931
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:09,220
I'll be very honest with you.

932
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:12,970
Seeing your granny and mother veiled,
I felt suffocated.

933
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:17,303
Don't attack my family.
So why did you start our affair?

934
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:19,970
Was it only me?
You did nothing?

935
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:21,762
Basically,

936
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:26,637
- you were using my body.
- What?

937
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:29,887
In the 70s, your modern granny
used my grandpa.

938
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,720
Don't attack my family.

939
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:35,262
Let me make one thing very clear,
Rocky.

940
01:00:35,387 --> 01:00:37,517
Neither of us used each other.

941
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:40,137
Whatever happened between us
was consensual.

942
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:44,178
Can you repeat?

943
01:00:46,303 --> 01:00:49,558
Consensual means we did it willingly.

944
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:51,303
You were willing, so was I.

945
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,345
Grandma was right.

946
01:00:55,762 --> 01:00:57,928
"Never be too sweet
or you'll be eaten up."

947
01:00:58,303 --> 01:01:00,012
- Stop it, Rocky.
- Ya, let's stop it.

948
01:01:00,884 --> 01:01:02,303
Yes, let's stop our story.

949
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,345
I'm breaking off.

950
01:01:04,637 --> 01:01:06,720
Rocky, you're overreacting.
Rocky, stop!

951
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:08,637
Let's talk. Where you going?

952
01:01:08,845 --> 01:01:10,345
To learn the names of our presidents.

953
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:13,053
Is this love or a college exam?

954
01:01:15,535 --> 01:01:18,678
Like a fool I've had this ring
in my pocket for days.

955
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:23,512
I wear the latest fashion, Rani.
But my heart's old-fashioned.

956
01:01:24,928 --> 01:01:26,553
I don't want just physical.

957
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:29,582
Mental, emotional, consexual.
All or nothing.

958
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,095
But you have nothing for me
in your heart.

959
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,512
OK.

960
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,220
Whatevs...

961
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:40,053
Rocky!

962
01:01:42,137 --> 01:01:44,053
Rocky, say what you want.

963
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:14,178
Rani, listen.

964
01:02:14,303 --> 01:02:16,928
Thakuma, it's too much.
I don't want to discuss this.

965
01:02:17,389 --> 01:02:20,887
I shouldn't waste time with such a family,
nor should you. That's it.

966
01:02:21,012 --> 01:02:25,137
Right. After all, it's just
a fling, just a thing. No?

967
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:26,345
Yeah.

968
01:02:27,921 --> 01:02:29,303
It's just a fling.

969
01:02:33,345 --> 01:02:36,387
Whenever I imagine you can't
do anything worse,

970
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:38,512
you break your own record.

971
01:02:38,678 --> 01:02:39,637
Listen to his side.

972
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,387
- Papa-ji...
- Stop. Enough!

973
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:48,053
If I catch this Romeo and Juliet
together again,

974
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:51,720
you'll be walking over my dead body.

975
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:11,336
He blocked me.

976
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:19,979
Grandpa, you must forget Jamini.

977
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,297
These Chatterjee girls...
they are ditchers!

978
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,422
They are ditchers!

979
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:33,498
Give me a hug!

980
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:40,890
So, ready for the Kashmir work trip?

981
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,977
You know, Somen, I'm so ready.

982
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:46,018
And I'm so excited that I just
can't control myself.

983
01:03:48,852 --> 01:03:50,518
- Somen.
- Hmm?

984
01:03:51,352 --> 01:03:52,518
Can you hug me?

985
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:56,560
A hug? You know?

986
01:03:57,352 --> 01:03:58,352
Here?

987
01:03:59,747 --> 01:04:01,018
Then where?

988
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,462
Hug me, Somen!

989
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,018
Forget it.

990
01:04:16,157 --> 01:04:18,060
- Let's try again. From this side?
- No!

991
01:04:18,972 --> 01:04:21,102
It's fine... it's fine.

992
01:04:22,185 --> 01:04:23,602
It's not fine.

993
01:05:03,804 --> 01:05:07,720
Colourless were the days

994
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:13,054
Colourless were the nights

995
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:18,095
To my world

996
01:05:19,122 --> 01:05:22,179
You brought colour

997
01:05:25,243 --> 01:05:28,429
Bland were the moments

998
01:05:30,554 --> 01:05:33,595
Lived till today

999
01:05:35,856 --> 01:05:38,429
To my world

1000
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:43,012
You brought life

1001
01:05:46,345 --> 01:05:48,554
Paths going nowhere

1002
01:05:49,004 --> 01:05:51,262
Now lead somewhere

1003
01:05:51,696 --> 01:05:54,179
You make all troubles disappear

1004
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:56,679
You can be trouble too

1005
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,220
Since the day we met

1006
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,918
Since the day we met

1007
01:06:02,361 --> 01:06:04,387
I'm no longer me

1008
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:07,054
Since the day we met

1009
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:11,054
My heart came to flower

1010
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:15,304
With the coming of spring

1011
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:17,762
Since the day we met

1012
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,690
Since the day we met

1013
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:23,226
Since the day we met

1014
01:06:23,674 --> 01:06:25,823
Since the day we met

1015
01:06:26,368 --> 01:06:28,367
Since the day we met

1016
01:06:50,211 --> 01:06:54,179
The pages of our life were blank

1017
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:58,970
Without love in our lives

1018
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:04,720
Heartaches run through lines
of verse

1019
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,554
For those with love stories

1020
01:07:11,637 --> 01:07:15,845
There was a time when
we had no name

1021
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:21,095
Now they call us the eternal lovers

1022
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,304
Since the day we met

1023
01:07:25,048 --> 01:07:27,112
Since the day we met

1024
01:07:27,665 --> 01:07:29,970
I'm no longer me

1025
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:32,304
Since the day we met

1026
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:37,345
My heart came to flower

1027
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:40,720
With the coming of spring

1028
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:42,929
Since the day we met

1029
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:45,518
Since the day we met

1030
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:48,228
Since the day we met

1031
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:51,207
Since the day we met

1032
01:07:51,728 --> 01:07:53,906
Since the day we met

1033
01:07:54,578 --> 01:07:56,434
Since the day we met

1034
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:58,788
Since the day we met

1035
01:07:59,682 --> 01:08:01,285
Since the day we met

1036
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,932
Since the day we met

1037
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:06,916
Since the day we met

1038
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:09,323
Since the day we met

1039
01:08:10,338 --> 01:08:11,838
Since the day we met

1040
01:08:12,986 --> 01:08:14,960
Since the day we met

1041
01:08:15,641 --> 01:08:17,579
Since the day we met

1042
01:08:18,326 --> 01:08:20,368
Since the day we met

1043
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:23,144
Since the day we met

1044
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,122
Since the day we met

1045
01:08:30,413 --> 01:08:32,387
Get the proforma. Get the work done.

1046
01:08:34,245 --> 01:08:36,361
Come on, baby. Sit in my car

1047
01:08:36,641 --> 01:08:38,704
Come on, baby. Sit in my car

1048
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:41,037
Come on, baby. Sit in my car

1049
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:43,539
Come on, baby. Sit in my car

1050
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:46,639
- Rocky.
- Go away!

1051
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:49,304
Rocky, two minutes.
I want to talk to you.

1052
01:08:50,804 --> 01:08:51,739
Rocky!

1053
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:53,762
Shut up!

1054
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:03,968
Rocky and Rani

1055
01:09:06,429 --> 01:09:08,011
Rocky and Rani

1056
01:09:10,421 --> 01:09:11,818
Rocky, stop!

1057
01:09:14,326 --> 01:09:17,869
Rocky and Rani's Love Story

1058
01:09:20,262 --> 01:09:21,595
Rocky, stop, please.

1059
01:09:25,363 --> 01:09:29,132
Their love is modern

1060
01:09:29,392 --> 01:09:33,146
But they fight conventionally

1061
01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:35,085
Rocky and Rani

1062
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,107
Rocky and Rani

1063
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:47,132
Rocky and Rani

1064
01:09:47,401 --> 01:09:49,066
Rocky and Rani

1065
01:09:51,212 --> 01:09:52,554
Damn it!

1066
01:09:59,868 --> 01:10:02,095
Vot the bluddy hell! You're crazy.

1067
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:03,970
I told you to stop the car.

1068
01:10:04,095 --> 01:10:05,470
I wrapped my car two weeks ago.

1069
01:10:05,595 --> 01:10:08,804
- Why did you block me?
- You sent hundreds of messages.

1070
01:10:09,512 --> 01:10:11,387
I didn't understand your English.

1071
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:13,804
Be quiet. I want to talk.

1072
01:10:13,929 --> 01:10:16,137
You never let anyone speak.

1073
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:18,179
Be quiet!

1074
01:10:19,204 --> 01:10:21,887
I'll do the talking. Shut up!

1075
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,054
I graduated from LSR.

1076
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:29,095
Did my post-grad in Columbia.
All my exes were high achievers.

1077
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,054
Some in economics,
others in banking.

1078
01:10:31,179 --> 01:10:33,387
One is looking for the cure to cancer.
Seriously!

1079
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:37,054
Then you landed up in my life,

1080
01:10:38,222 --> 01:10:41,762
with a protein shake in your hand
and a shirt wide open.

1081
01:10:42,095 --> 01:10:45,304
Limitless hotness and in strange English,
you said:

1082
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:49,220
"Hi, Rani! How's you?
Rocky Randhawa this side."

1083
01:10:50,402 --> 01:10:53,762
My head said we had nothing
in common.

1084
01:10:53,887 --> 01:10:58,179
It's just a physical thing.
Just a fling, just a thing.

1085
01:10:58,304 --> 01:10:59,554
But, no...

1086
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:04,762
I was wrong.

1087
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:08,720
My heart got in the way.

1088
01:11:14,273 --> 01:11:17,929
Rocky Randhawa from Karol Bagh,
I'm in love with you.

1089
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:22,304
I see you everywhere,
that kinda love.

1090
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,220
I hear violins playing,
that kinda love.

1091
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:30,887
To hold your hand forever,
that kinda love.

1092
01:11:31,137 --> 01:11:33,470
Endless love,
that kinda love.

1093
01:11:35,847 --> 01:11:38,262
Give our love story
another chance.

1094
01:11:39,554 --> 01:11:41,054
Rocky Randhawa this side.

1095
01:11:41,845 --> 01:11:43,220
Come to my side.

1096
01:11:46,012 --> 01:11:46,970
Please?

1097
01:11:51,131 --> 01:11:52,137
Please...

1098
01:12:16,317 --> 01:12:22,470
Don't go away, don't leave me now

1099
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:30,262
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

1100
01:12:42,952 --> 01:12:47,220
Don't go away, don't leave me now

1101
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:51,679
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

1102
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:56,534
Don't go away, don't leave me now

1103
01:12:57,132 --> 01:13:01,056
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

1104
01:13:01,626 --> 01:13:05,929
This is a story that has no end

1105
01:13:11,078 --> 01:13:14,887
No, not now. No, not now

1106
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:18,929
No, no, no, no

1107
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:24,262
Don't go away, don't leave me now

1108
01:13:24,848 --> 01:13:28,845
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

1109
01:13:32,095 --> 01:13:33,469
Don't mind.

1110
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:40,707
Don't go away, don't leave me now

1111
01:13:41,267 --> 01:13:45,174
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

1112
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:49,819
Don't go away, don't leave me now

1113
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:54,232
My heart hasn't had its fill
of you

1114
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:01,804
What will it be?

1115
01:14:02,179 --> 01:14:03,929
Dastination or Dhanlakshmi?

1116
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:06,095
- What?
- Our wedding.

1117
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:15,512
What is it now?

1118
01:14:15,887 --> 01:14:16,845
Roc -

1119
01:14:19,111 --> 01:14:20,161
Rani!

1120
01:14:23,012 --> 01:14:24,720
- So you want to get married?
- Yes.

1121
01:14:24,929 --> 01:14:27,970
Your groom is coming
on a white horse for you!

1122
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:28,929
Hold your horses!

1123
01:14:29,054 --> 01:14:31,137
Tell me where will we live
after we get married?

1124
01:14:31,345 --> 01:14:34,220
- Randhawa Paradise. Where else?
- See! That's the problem!

1125
01:14:34,502 --> 01:14:37,929
What problem? After marrizz, the lady
moves to the husband's house.

1126
01:14:38,054 --> 01:14:40,179
After marriage, the wife moves
to her husband's!

1127
01:14:40,304 --> 01:14:43,184
Who wrote that rule? Is it
in the Constitution?

1128
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:44,429
I dunno. I never read it.

1129
01:14:44,554 --> 01:14:46,762
Baby, it's not in the Constitution.

1130
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:50,720
Everyone assumes the girl will live
at her husband's after marriage.

1131
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:54,304
You move in and you'll see,
we'll adjust.

1132
01:14:54,429 --> 01:14:56,304
Adjust? When was the last time
you adjusted?

1133
01:14:56,429 --> 01:14:58,970
You never adjust. And eventually
I know what'll happen.

1134
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:01,595
I'll end up doing all the adjusting,
and I'm not OK with that.

1135
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,115
Don't get cross.

1136
01:15:03,762 --> 01:15:06,554
I'm not arguing. I agree with you.

1137
01:15:06,804 --> 01:15:10,554
Be gentle. Handle with care.
I'm a fragile.

1138
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:12,345
My baby.

1139
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:19,179
Once we get married, would you consider
living with my family?

1140
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:23,637
- Don't split up my family.
- This is exactly what I'm saying.

1141
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:28,095
Wouldn't my family be split up,
if I moved to Randhawa Paradise?

1142
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:30,929
It must work both ways, no?

1143
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:36,429
So let's have it your fancy way.
What do you want? Live-in?

1144
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,970
I wish! Live-in won't change anything.

1145
01:15:39,095 --> 01:15:42,220
The problem is our families
are so different.

1146
01:15:43,179 --> 01:15:45,637
We may hold the steering wheel
in our hands,

1147
01:15:45,762 --> 01:15:48,429
but it's the family that does
the backseat driving. That's a fact.

1148
01:15:48,554 --> 01:15:51,845
Who drives from the backseat?
Nonsense, Rani.

1149
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,637
I didn't mean it literally, Rocky.

1150
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:55,845
- It's a metaphor.
- Metaphor, meanz?

1151
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:58,845
- So our families are different.
- Our families are very different.

1152
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,387
We have very different ideologies...

1153
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:05,225
You want me to live with your family?
And you live with mine?

1154
01:16:05,345 --> 01:16:08,751
Are you suggesting you'll live
with my family and I... Oh my God!

1155
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:11,637
Oh my God.

1156
01:16:15,345 --> 01:16:17,436
- Genius!
- Who?

1157
01:16:22,054 --> 01:16:23,429
You're a genius.

1158
01:16:26,637 --> 01:16:27,429
That's true!

1159
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:28,804
What are you saying?

1160
01:16:29,095 --> 01:16:30,429
Ma, hear me out please.

1161
01:16:30,554 --> 01:16:32,929
It's outrageous.

1162
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:36,262
Why are you experimenting
with your life?

1163
01:16:36,762 --> 01:16:39,845
In fact, if more people experimented
before marriage,

1164
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,387
there'd be less divorces in the world.
Don't you think?

1165
01:16:42,762 --> 01:16:45,554
It's for only three months.
Think of him as a house guest.

1166
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:47,304
House guest? A house pest!

1167
01:16:47,429 --> 01:16:51,095
Exactly. Exactly.
That Rambo... Randhawa...

1168
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,607
- Rocky!
- Yes! Rocky.

1169
01:16:52,929 --> 01:16:54,762
You must understand Rocky...

1170
01:16:54,887 --> 01:16:55,804
Tomato allergy!

1171
01:16:55,929 --> 01:16:57,595
And I'm allergic to that boy.

1172
01:16:57,715 --> 01:16:59,304
Allergic is a bit overdramatic, Baba.

1173
01:16:59,557 --> 01:17:03,304
How can we possibly live with that madcap
for three months?

1174
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,142
Plus that boy, he's got no class,
no standards.

1175
01:17:06,262 --> 01:17:07,762
Class and standards?

1176
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:10,762
Father, you're so educated,
is this how you think?

1177
01:17:11,012 --> 01:17:12,512
No, no, one second.
I don't know about Rocky,

1178
01:17:12,637 --> 01:17:14,142
but I think you have double standards,
father.

1179
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:15,512
Mind your manners.

1180
01:17:15,637 --> 01:17:18,470
- Did you hear what he said?
- What did I say?

1181
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:19,970
Stop it!

1182
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:22,262
Come here.

1183
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:25,012
Ma, put some sense into her.

1184
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:27,470
Tell me.

1185
01:17:27,762 --> 01:17:32,970
If neither of you can adjust
to each other's family, then what?

1186
01:17:34,179 --> 01:17:36,512
End of your relationship?

1187
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:41,429
Thakuma, I know you ended your relationship
because of your family.

1188
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:43,929
And I respect that.
But times have changed.

1189
01:17:44,512 --> 01:17:48,012
Rocky and I love each other very much.
We're going to make this work.

1190
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:50,095
What's not working right now
are you guys.

1191
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:53,637
You should support me.
Is that too much to ask?

1192
01:17:56,929 --> 01:17:59,262
Have you gone crazy? I'll give you
one slap.

1193
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,387
Shut up! Don't butt in.

1194
01:18:01,804 --> 01:18:04,970
- How dare you?
- Tijori, one minute.

1195
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:12,345
So, in three months, Rani will decide
if our family is worthy of her. Yes?

1196
01:18:12,804 --> 01:18:14,720
No, grandma. You're getting it all wrong.

1197
01:18:15,262 --> 01:18:17,012
What if we don't like Rani?

1198
01:18:17,929 --> 01:18:20,220
Will you do as I say?

1199
01:18:24,429 --> 01:18:26,804
Grandma, your word is final for me.

1200
01:18:27,637 --> 01:18:30,637
But for my sake,

1201
01:18:33,429 --> 01:18:36,137
give Rani a genuine chance?

1202
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:48,095
I agree. I accept.
Go tell her.

1203
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,595
- Mummy!
- I've said what I had to.

1204
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:53,804
Now go!

1205
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,929
I want to talk to Tijori alone.
Everyone, go.

1206
01:18:57,406 --> 01:19:01,285
The whole world is for me

1207
01:19:03,262 --> 01:19:05,595
Mummy, what are you doing?
You agreed?

1208
01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:09,929
Do you want to lose your only son?

1209
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:11,470
Hmm?

1210
01:19:13,012 --> 01:19:16,429
Have you seen his eyes?
He's in love.

1211
01:19:17,262 --> 01:19:19,429
That love will turn to rebellion.

1212
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:21,637
He'll turn his back on us and leave.

1213
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:23,262
Who'll inherit our empire?

1214
01:19:24,095 --> 01:19:25,554
Who will be your heir?

1215
01:19:31,845 --> 01:19:33,220
Let the girl come.

1216
01:19:34,139 --> 01:19:37,595
Three months?
She won't last a week.

1217
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:43,929
If I don't put an end
to their love story,

1218
01:19:45,691 --> 01:19:47,304
my name is not Dhanlakshmi.

1219
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:48,996
Understand?

1220
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,535
I see you near me, yeah

1221
01:20:16,785 --> 01:20:18,493
Take care of my heart, yeah

1222
01:20:18,743 --> 01:20:20,535
Why the distance between us?

1223
01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:22,618
I can see you

1224
01:20:23,243 --> 01:20:26,410
Without you the world is poison

1225
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,535
No one can take you from me

1226
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:30,576
I fought so much for you, yeah

1227
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:34,868
I can't handle the heat,
you're fire

1228
01:20:35,243 --> 01:20:38,660
I'll make you mine,
that's my desire

1229
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:42,857
I can't handle the heat,
you're fire

1230
01:20:43,273 --> 01:20:45,306
I'll make you mine

1231
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:49,910
Baby, I'm your lover

1232
01:20:50,264 --> 01:20:53,743
Baby, I'm your lover

1233
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:07,180
[Chanting]

1234
01:21:07,486 --> 01:21:08,637
Sorry, my bags...

1235
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:17,425
[Chanting]

1236
01:21:28,093 --> 01:21:29,676
'Prasad' is first offered to guests.

1237
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,301
Right hand.

1238
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:39,968
- I wanted...
- Give some...

1239
01:21:42,561 --> 01:21:44,301
Give some to everyone in the house.

1240
01:21:47,047 --> 01:21:48,426
I'd like to say something.

1241
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:51,884
I know that our culture,

1242
01:21:52,101 --> 01:21:55,384
our backgrounds, even our thinking
is very different.

1243
01:21:56,838 --> 01:21:59,634
- But we have something in common...
- We have nothing in common.

1244
01:22:03,642 --> 01:22:04,384
We do.

1245
01:22:05,704 --> 01:22:07,301
Our love for Rocky.

1246
01:22:08,759 --> 01:22:10,176
Since when have you known Rocky?

1247
01:22:12,448 --> 01:22:13,593
7 months, 17 days.

1248
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:16,051
You have a good memory.

1249
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:21,169
You hardly know him, and we've known him
all his life.

1250
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,593
Ironically enough though,

1251
01:22:28,371 --> 01:22:31,926
sometimes a few moments give you
enough love for a lifetime.

1252
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:35,218
Sometimes a lifetime together

1253
01:22:35,759 --> 01:22:37,384
doesn't give you love.

1254
01:22:41,634 --> 01:22:43,551
You have a way with words.

1255
01:22:43,966 --> 01:22:47,968
Your style must work on
your TV channel.

1256
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:52,259
But our home is guided
by certain principles.

1257
01:22:53,339 --> 01:22:57,176
This is the first time we've broken
the rules.

1258
01:22:58,301 --> 01:23:01,176
We believe no decent girl

1259
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:05,759
should be living in a stranger's house
without being married.

1260
01:23:06,791 --> 01:23:08,218
I have only one request.

1261
01:23:08,838 --> 01:23:12,593
Treat me as a family member,
not as a guest.

1262
01:23:14,301 --> 01:23:16,634
I'm sure we could try.

1263
01:23:17,584 --> 01:23:20,301
We are trying, that's why you're here.

1264
01:23:20,884 --> 01:23:22,593
Dinner will be served at 9.

1265
01:23:30,259 --> 01:23:32,223
You can't find the way.
Don't go round in circles.

1266
01:23:32,343 --> 01:23:36,051
Why don't you make use of the magnificence
of the global positioning system?

1267
01:23:36,343 --> 01:23:37,301
In English, please.

1268
01:23:37,509 --> 01:23:39,176
GPS is English.

1269
01:23:39,301 --> 01:23:41,389
Why do you always have to use
such big, huge words?

1270
01:23:41,509 --> 01:23:42,311
Hallo.

1271
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:46,509
Hallo and valcome.

1272
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:48,718
Rocky Randhawa!

1273
01:23:49,813 --> 01:23:52,884
All I wish to say, coming here today

1274
01:23:53,412 --> 01:23:56,068
I'm so heppy, so heppy.

1275
01:23:56,843 --> 01:23:59,681
I'm so full of heppiness
that I could burst!

1276
01:24:00,029 --> 01:24:02,134
Just too heppy to be here.

1277
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:04,676
That calls for a team huddle.

1278
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:12,593
No huddle? No cuddle?

1279
01:24:13,551 --> 01:24:15,134
- Rocky, come.
- Thakuma!

1280
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:18,134
- Looking hot and sexy...
- Mother!

1281
01:24:18,259 --> 01:24:20,884
just like Sridevi in that song
about the endless night.

1282
01:24:21,127 --> 01:24:22,676
You crazy boy!

1283
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:25,218
- Come!
- No, no, no, no!

1284
01:24:25,343 --> 01:24:26,593
No, no, no, no!

1285
01:24:26,713 --> 01:24:28,926
No touching. Overfamiliarity
breeds contempt!

1286
01:24:29,218 --> 01:24:31,264
But why? I'm double vax.

1287
01:24:31,384 --> 01:24:34,181
Soshal distancing is over.
Who said it.

1288
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,509
- Who?
- Who.

1289
01:24:35,634 --> 01:24:37,009
- Who?
- Who.

1290
01:24:37,134 --> 01:24:38,551
- Who, who?
- WHO.

1291
01:24:38,676 --> 01:24:40,468
World Health Organisation!

1292
01:24:40,795 --> 01:24:42,843
World Haalth Organisation!

1293
01:24:42,963 --> 01:24:47,134
Your general knowledge is weak.
Next time I'll give four option answers.

1294
01:24:47,259 --> 01:24:49,759
- Where going? Where going?
- Outside.

1295
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:52,968
- I know you aalso want!
- I don't want it at all.

1296
01:24:53,218 --> 01:24:54,426
I don't want your cuddle.

1297
01:24:56,843 --> 01:24:58,593
What's happening?

1298
01:24:59,412 --> 01:25:00,593
What's going on?

1299
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:05,223
Why are you allergic to a hug?

1300
01:25:05,343 --> 01:25:08,676
A hug is good for haalth!
A hug is important for being human.

1301
01:25:08,926 --> 01:25:11,676
A hug is like... a hug!

1302
01:25:11,843 --> 01:25:16,093
I get it! I get you and I get your hugs.

1303
01:25:16,357 --> 01:25:20,051
Hugging and dancing. He'll be dancing
the Bhangra all day.

1304
01:25:20,176 --> 01:25:24,134
Dancing 'Balle balle' is life.
It's a theory.

1305
01:25:24,259 --> 01:25:26,677
Good God! A coma would be more
pleasurable right now,

1306
01:25:26,843 --> 01:25:29,343
rather than this ridiculous diddly squat.

1307
01:25:29,676 --> 01:25:33,426
I do squat. 150 kilo.
New personal record!

1308
01:25:33,681 --> 01:25:34,676
- Huh?
- Yes.

1309
01:25:36,926 --> 01:25:38,259
Oh, ho, ho!

1310
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,093
Respected grandfather!

1311
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:45,093
That's Shree Rabindranath Tagore.

1312
01:25:49,009 --> 01:25:49,676
I know!

1313
01:25:51,497 --> 01:25:55,093
There was some filter on the picture,
so could not make out.

1314
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:57,301
- What?
- Come on.

1315
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,134
Let's go to your room.

1316
01:26:04,051 --> 01:26:05,349
Come on!

1317
01:26:19,176 --> 01:26:20,301
Grandpa?

1318
01:26:23,051 --> 01:26:25,093
Grandma sent this for you.

1319
01:26:33,565 --> 01:26:35,009
Another surprise.

1320
01:26:37,468 --> 01:26:41,301
Kanwal-ji. Red is your
favourite colour, right?

1321
01:26:42,008 --> 01:26:46,343
I knitted this muffler for you.
You must use it.

1322
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:49,093
Isn't it amazing?

1323
01:26:49,718 --> 01:26:54,051
Our Rani is with you and your Rocky
is with us.

1324
01:26:54,979 --> 01:27:00,051
Looks like those unfulfilled
dreams of ours

1325
01:27:00,884 --> 01:27:04,239
are now the dreams of Rani and Rocky.

1326
01:27:05,555 --> 01:27:06,828
This time

1327
01:27:07,854 --> 01:27:10,926
they may just fulfill them.

1328
01:27:16,502 --> 01:27:19,718
Stay well. Your Jamini.

1329
01:27:26,578 --> 01:27:28,051
Pass me the 'bhindi'.

1330
01:27:29,728 --> 01:27:31,034
Rajma.

1331
01:27:31,616 --> 01:27:32,884
Paneer.

1332
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:35,884
Just a little. Enough.

1333
01:27:40,134 --> 01:27:41,551
The phulka is cold.

1334
01:27:41,968 --> 01:27:43,051
I'll get you another.

1335
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:45,239
Her phulka must be cold too.

1336
01:27:47,381 --> 01:27:48,634
Aunty, sit down. I'll get it.

1337
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,884
No, Poonam, you go.

1338
01:27:51,843 --> 01:27:54,218
You're a guest. Sit down.

1339
01:27:54,582 --> 01:27:56,551
I insist, please.

1340
01:28:04,759 --> 01:28:05,804
Here you are.

1341
01:28:06,509 --> 01:28:08,134
Nice hot phulkas.

1342
01:28:11,511 --> 01:28:14,593
At home, we're used to fetching stuff
from the kitchen when we're eating.

1343
01:28:15,313 --> 01:28:16,800
We set the table together.

1344
01:28:17,301 --> 01:28:18,968
We serve one another.

1345
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:22,093
And we clear the table together too.

1346
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:23,593
That never happens here.

1347
01:28:23,884 --> 01:28:25,593
Here Mummy orgasms every day.

1348
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:32,426
Organises... organises!

1349
01:28:35,968 --> 01:28:37,181
You're like the trader Harshad Mehta!

1350
01:28:37,301 --> 01:28:39,718
The stock market is strong.
Buy Tata.

1351
01:28:39,964 --> 01:28:41,593
- Gayatri?
- Bata!

1352
01:28:42,676 --> 01:28:44,759
I was ordering Bata shoes.
You want something?

1353
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:46,926
No, I was going to the kitchen.
Need anything?

1354
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:48,551
No, thanks. You carry on.

1355
01:28:48,968 --> 01:28:49,843
OK.

1356
01:28:51,551 --> 01:28:53,077
Yes, buy Ba... Tata.

1357
01:28:53,509 --> 01:28:54,634
You're still here?

1358
01:28:54,759 --> 01:28:57,384
Go. We need to get up early to pray
with grandma.

1359
01:28:57,884 --> 01:28:59,426
I'll do it. Go, good night.

1360
01:29:11,044 --> 01:29:14,426
If I found someone like you

1361
01:29:15,255 --> 01:29:19,259
If I found someone like you

1362
01:29:19,629 --> 01:29:22,426
Life would be easy

1363
01:29:23,516 --> 01:29:26,551
Life would be easy

1364
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:33,626
If I found someone like you--

1365
01:29:37,478 --> 01:29:40,218
I usually drink hot milk
with turmeric at night.

1366
01:29:42,612 --> 01:29:43,884
I'll heat up the milk for you.

1367
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:45,676
Don't worry, aunty, I can do it.

1368
01:29:46,343 --> 01:29:48,218
You've already done enough today.

1369
01:29:50,884 --> 01:29:54,218
I enjoy making hot phulkas
for my husband.

1370
01:29:54,437 --> 01:29:57,384
My mother used to make
hot phulkas for my father.

1371
01:29:57,676 --> 01:29:59,384
So did my grandma.

1372
01:30:01,218 --> 01:30:02,343
That's our tradition.

1373
01:30:04,884 --> 01:30:06,426
Does that mean it's right?

1374
01:30:07,009 --> 01:30:08,759
Must you decide what's right
or wrong?

1375
01:30:09,259 --> 01:30:11,593
There's nothing wrong in serving
your husband.

1376
01:30:12,154 --> 01:30:16,301
I agree. In fact, there's nothing
nobler than serving others.

1377
01:30:16,843 --> 01:30:19,968
But if service is only one way,
it isn't service,

1378
01:30:20,866 --> 01:30:21,718
it's slavery.

1379
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:32,884
Good night.

1380
01:30:40,312 --> 01:30:41,759
Alexa! Snooj.

1381
01:30:44,676 --> 01:30:45,718
Snooj.

1382
01:31:20,754 --> 01:31:22,301
What's with uncle?

1383
01:31:22,926 --> 01:31:25,843
- Is he possessed by the star Madhuri?
- Madhuri?

1384
01:31:26,759 --> 01:31:29,176
He's practicing his dance steps.

1385
01:31:29,426 --> 01:31:31,384
- Kathak.
- Gents' Kathak?

1386
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:33,593
Sit down.

1387
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:38,009
Very humid and sweaty!

1388
01:31:38,218 --> 01:31:39,634
Want some tea?

1389
01:31:40,222 --> 01:31:41,218
Let me.

1390
01:31:41,657 --> 01:31:45,468
Only 42% are voting, it's appalling.

1391
01:31:45,844 --> 01:31:47,421
Only 42%? Really?

1392
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:51,426
Voting is our national duty
as citizens.

1393
01:31:51,676 --> 01:31:53,509
The voting lines must have closed
by now.

1394
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:57,009
- Voting lines?
- I've stopped voting.

1395
01:31:57,134 --> 01:31:59,509
You stop voting too. Shamita
is out of the house.

1396
01:31:59,968 --> 01:32:01,634
- Shamita?
- Shamita.

1397
01:32:01,824 --> 01:32:03,176
Which constituency
does she represent?

1398
01:32:03,738 --> 01:32:04,926
Bigg Boss!

1399
01:32:08,301 --> 01:32:09,843
Son, will you have some tea?

1400
01:32:10,134 --> 01:32:12,884
No, grandma says drinking tea darkens
the skin.

1401
01:32:13,343 --> 01:32:15,843
So? What's wrong with being dark?

1402
01:32:17,343 --> 01:32:19,593
Of all the things, he's also
decidedly racist!

1403
01:32:19,718 --> 01:32:22,301
No, no, aunty. It's not like that
at all.

1404
01:32:23,113 --> 01:32:24,426
Black Lives Matter.

1405
01:32:24,676 --> 01:32:29,384
I have no personal problem with Black folk.
Beyonce and Rihanna are lovely.

1406
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:32,176
When I cruise around at night,
it's hip-hop.

1407
01:32:32,301 --> 01:32:33,617
Drake, Kanye West...

1408
01:32:34,051 --> 01:32:37,926
My favourite song at weddings
that always make me dance...

1409
01:32:38,046 --> 01:32:39,898
"Black is beautiful"

1410
01:32:40,582 --> 01:32:44,134
"Black is beautiful,
like my dark skinned beloved"

1411
01:32:44,259 --> 01:32:45,509
"Keep the fair-skinned ones away"

1412
01:32:45,718 --> 01:32:46,593
Sing with me!

1413
01:32:48,134 --> 01:32:50,759
Very good, very good.

1414
01:32:51,301 --> 01:32:53,176
So do you want black coffee?

1415
01:32:53,884 --> 01:32:56,176
Go to the kitchen. Left of the stove,

1416
01:32:56,426 --> 01:32:58,426
on the second shelf, there's coffee
and sugar.

1417
01:32:58,551 --> 01:33:01,384
- If you need milk, it's in the fridge.
- No milk for me.

1418
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,426
Go make it.

1419
01:33:10,884 --> 01:33:11,759
Self-service?

1420
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:15,538
Like food court?

1421
01:33:17,906 --> 01:33:18,586
Go!

1422
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:23,801
I can do whatever I want

1423
01:33:25,315 --> 01:33:28,678
Under the canopy of roses

1424
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,468
Put this in the kitchen.

1425
01:33:35,953 --> 01:33:37,114
Do you need something?

1426
01:33:37,426 --> 01:33:40,468
No, I thought I'd spend
a little time with you.

1427
01:33:42,688 --> 01:33:44,176
You think a lot.

1428
01:33:56,053 --> 01:33:58,593
He doesn't even know how to turn
on a gas stove.

1429
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:03,339
He thinks Tagore is your grandfather.

1430
01:34:06,946 --> 01:34:08,030
Hallos!

1431
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,361
- Shobha.
- Somen.

1432
01:34:10,594 --> 01:34:11,652
- You here too?
- Somen.

1433
01:34:12,143 --> 01:34:13,794
- Bring it in!
- Rani, let's go!

1434
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:15,736
- Nice to meet you.
- Rani, let's go!

1435
01:34:15,856 --> 01:34:17,944
It's Rani's break time.
You go ahead.

1436
01:34:19,474 --> 01:34:20,731
Disgusting!

1437
01:34:34,648 --> 01:34:36,523
What are you doing?
Someone will see us.

1438
01:34:36,643 --> 01:34:39,064
- Can't you even light a gas stove?
- Can't you eat without talking?

1439
01:34:39,184 --> 01:34:41,189
Without talking! Guts!

1440
01:34:41,674 --> 01:34:43,606
I was just trying to help your mother.

1441
01:34:43,731 --> 01:34:45,273
You're the baest girlfrand.

1442
01:34:45,734 --> 01:34:47,736
- How's my mom treating you?
- She dislikes me.

1443
01:34:47,856 --> 01:34:49,856
- And how's my mom?
- She dislikes me.

1444
01:34:54,171 --> 01:34:57,398
Your home is on the other shore

1445
01:34:58,106 --> 01:35:01,148
O stranger from a distant land

1446
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:05,106
O stranger from a distant land

1447
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:09,898
I've seen you on autumn mornings

1448
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:13,856
I've seen you on fragrant nights

1449
01:35:15,657 --> 01:35:17,432
I've seen you

1450
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,856
I hear you in my heartbeat

1451
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,898
O stranger from a distant land

1452
01:35:29,398 --> 01:35:30,852
Bravo!

1453
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:33,398
Wow, Jamini! Outstanding!

1454
01:35:33,523 --> 01:35:35,231
You're great, Thakuma.

1455
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,564
- Rocky!
- Bravo, Jamini!

1456
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:41,064
It's amazing that you still
don't need reading glasses.

1457
01:35:41,231 --> 01:35:42,689
- And cheers to that!
- Cheers!

1458
01:35:42,814 --> 01:35:46,231
I agree! You don't need glasses.
Drink straight from the bottle.

1459
01:35:47,523 --> 01:35:48,439
Who's that?

1460
01:35:49,008 --> 01:35:51,773
Rocky. Our house guest.

1461
01:35:53,025 --> 01:35:54,856
Hallo! Hallo!

1462
01:35:55,095 --> 01:35:58,856
Rocky, this is our culture club.
Come, join us.

1463
01:35:59,602 --> 01:36:02,814
Ma, I don't think that's such
a great idea.

1464
01:36:02,981 --> 01:36:04,606
Rocky will get bored.

1465
01:36:04,882 --> 01:36:07,023
After all, this is a culture club thing.

1466
01:36:08,033 --> 01:36:10,273
Rocky, go to your room.

1467
01:36:10,393 --> 01:36:12,689
Do your exercises.

1468
01:36:14,457 --> 01:36:15,398
Or go and rest.

1469
01:36:16,929 --> 01:36:18,231
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

1470
01:36:26,257 --> 01:36:29,314
Yaa... recovery is important.

1471
01:36:29,699 --> 01:36:30,481
Hmm.

1472
01:36:33,523 --> 01:36:35,064
Won't you also sing?

1473
01:36:35,314 --> 01:36:37,856
I don't have my glasses today.

1474
01:36:38,222 --> 01:36:39,819
Rocky made a fool of himself
in front of

1475
01:36:39,939 --> 01:36:42,511
the very doyennes of high art
and culture during culture club.

1476
01:36:42,731 --> 01:36:44,898
How can you imagine marrying him?

1477
01:36:45,737 --> 01:36:46,231
Ma!

1478
01:36:46,398 --> 01:36:48,939
Think about it. He has no class,
no education,

1479
01:36:49,154 --> 01:36:50,736
no language, no culture-

1480
01:36:50,856 --> 01:36:52,106
Ma, he has a good heart!

1481
01:36:52,289 --> 01:36:53,856
So does my cardiologist.

1482
01:36:54,082 --> 01:36:57,273
- But I don't want you to marry him!
- I'm going now. I'll call you later.

1483
01:37:01,629 --> 01:37:03,606
Can't waste cake.

1484
01:37:04,009 --> 01:37:05,689
- It's sugar free.
- Fat free.

1485
01:37:06,145 --> 01:37:08,064
- Gluten free.
- And free.

1486
01:37:09,351 --> 01:37:10,898
- Milk and turmeric?
- No, no, I'll make it.

1487
01:37:11,135 --> 01:37:13,564
Don't worry.
Please carry on eating freely.

1488
01:37:27,995 --> 01:37:31,523
If I found someone like you

1489
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:35,106
If I found someone like you

1490
01:37:36,556 --> 01:37:39,273
Life would be so easy

1491
01:37:40,471 --> 01:37:42,801
Aha, life would be so easy

1492
01:37:45,774 --> 01:37:48,676
If I found someone like you

1493
01:37:49,908 --> 01:37:52,259
A new life would be born

1494
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:56,551
He would father a new life

1495
01:37:58,431 --> 01:38:01,009
Father a new life? Don't sing
your version in public!

1496
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:03,009
A flower needs the spring...

1497
01:38:03,249 --> 01:38:05,429
And the spring...?

1498
01:38:06,437 --> 01:38:07,587
What about the spring?

1499
01:38:08,566 --> 01:38:12,468
A flower needs the spring,
the spring needs the garden

1500
01:38:12,897 --> 01:38:16,676
The heart needs a heart,
a body needs a body

1501
01:38:17,446 --> 01:38:21,051
Everyone longs to meet
their soulmate

1502
01:38:21,908 --> 01:38:25,509
Hope I find my soulmate too

1503
01:38:26,364 --> 01:38:27,926
Whoa! Go for it!

1504
01:38:28,586 --> 01:38:31,259
Life would be so easy

1505
01:38:33,035 --> 01:38:35,384
Life would be so easy

1506
01:38:36,351 --> 01:38:37,384
Follow me!

1507
01:38:37,509 --> 01:38:40,551
If I found someone like you

1508
01:38:41,622 --> 01:38:43,801
Life would be so easy

1509
01:38:45,529 --> 01:38:47,968
Life would be so easy

1510
01:38:51,105 --> 01:38:53,634
Wow, aunty! You sing brilliantly!

1511
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:54,884
- Really?
- Yes.

1512
01:38:55,283 --> 01:38:57,645
I used to sing on the Prasar Bharati
radio station.

1513
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,218
Everyone said I'd be the next
Asha Bhosle.

1514
01:39:00,718 --> 01:39:01,634
And then?

1515
01:39:02,535 --> 01:39:03,509
I got married.

1516
01:39:04,676 --> 01:39:05,218
So?

1517
01:39:06,093 --> 01:39:08,718
In our home, getting married
is a girl's greatest dream.

1518
01:39:10,103 --> 01:39:10,968
And your dream?

1519
01:39:14,731 --> 01:39:18,343
Compromising is better than dreaming.
At least you don't get disappointed.

1520
01:39:21,142 --> 01:39:23,521
Poonam! I'm fed up.

1521
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:26,384
My husband will not eat,
or have his pills.

1522
01:39:26,509 --> 01:39:27,731
- Go to him.
- Yes.

1523
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:30,101
Let me try.

1524
01:39:39,315 --> 01:39:42,505
- Hello, Aunty! Howr' you?
- How can I help you?

1525
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:45,253
I was going to ask about my dirty
clothes. Londry?

1526
01:39:45,505 --> 01:39:49,342
Laundry? Go to your room, dial 9.
Somebody will be at your service.

1527
01:39:49,462 --> 01:39:50,395
OK.

1528
01:39:54,557 --> 01:39:56,713
Ah! I know you're playing a fun!

1529
01:39:56,833 --> 01:39:58,270
You are very jokey!

1530
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:59,781
It's one of my strongest suits.

1531
01:39:59,901 --> 01:40:03,505
Actually, my cloths are dirty.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

1532
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:05,880
Go to your bedroom,
remove your clothes. I'm coming.

1533
01:40:06,588 --> 01:40:09,588
Go to your bedroom,
remove your clothes. I'm coming.

1534
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:12,046
What is it?

1535
01:40:12,505 --> 01:40:14,838
That's wrong, Aunty.
You're Rani's mother.

1536
01:40:15,171 --> 01:40:16,546
Goodness me, no, no!

1537
01:40:17,824 --> 01:40:20,130
Not these clothes, you silly boy!

1538
01:40:20,422 --> 01:40:23,088
Your dirty clothes.
Keep the whites separate.

1539
01:40:23,213 --> 01:40:26,231
I don't want any kind of fuss over
pettifogging details later mind you.

1540
01:40:26,837 --> 01:40:30,046
- I didn't got you.
- I didn't 'get' you.

1541
01:40:30,605 --> 01:40:32,296
- I aalso.
- Huh?

1542
01:40:33,338 --> 01:40:35,218
Aunty, I don't want to give you
any load.

1543
01:40:35,338 --> 01:40:37,421
In fact, you should give me yours.

1544
01:40:37,546 --> 01:40:40,171
Phone me if there's anything
I can do. At your service!

1545
01:40:40,296 --> 01:40:42,463
Just tell me if I can do
anything for you.

1546
01:40:43,114 --> 01:40:44,505
Frankly, there's nothing now.

1547
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:46,630
I'm just about to embark
on a shopping expedition.

1548
01:40:46,847 --> 01:40:47,963
Shopping!

1549
01:40:48,088 --> 01:40:50,046
You're off to the market?
I'm coming too!

1550
01:40:50,463 --> 01:40:52,463
The thrill of going to a market
can never be felt online.

1551
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:56,893
What will you do there? I'm going
shopping for lingerie.

1552
01:40:58,083 --> 01:40:59,291
That's OK.

1553
01:40:59,583 --> 01:41:02,541
I can carry the bags for you.
My workout for the day.

1554
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:05,666
Whenever I go to a mall,
I cause a riot!

1555
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:08,291
I'm an expert shopper.
My choice is...

1556
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:10,166
Come along.

1557
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:13,083
We'll max out our cards today!

1558
01:41:16,982 --> 01:41:22,749
Ma, 36B. Rani, 32B and I'm 34C.

1559
01:41:22,999 --> 01:41:25,749
Your seat number? You're going
to the pictures?

1560
01:41:26,044 --> 01:41:27,666
SRK's latest is playing.

1561
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,999
Pictures?

1562
01:41:30,055 --> 01:41:32,458
I told you, I'm shopping
for bras.

1563
01:41:32,976 --> 01:41:34,374
Come on, there's a shop.

1564
01:41:34,577 --> 01:41:37,958
- What are you buying?
- A bra.

1565
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:44,624
Wow! There's some lovely
new stock in here.

1566
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:48,458
Oh Chintu, Chintu! How are you?

1567
01:41:49,388 --> 01:41:51,833
I'm like always happy Diwali, Aunty.

1568
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:54,958
OK then, show me something
new and exquisite.

1569
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:57,862
We have a buffet of items.

1570
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:00,416
Show me a Balconette.
Something with lace.

1571
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,874
A classy type.

1572
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:05,119
Here's your balcony!

1573
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:09,494
Yes, this is nice.

1574
01:42:10,098 --> 01:42:11,494
- Rocky?
- Nice.

1575
01:42:12,267 --> 01:42:16,487
But last time, there was a tad bit
of inconvenience with the hook.

1576
01:42:16,726 --> 01:42:18,593
It won't happen now. This stock is new.

1577
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:20,065
I'll show you.

1578
01:42:20,185 --> 01:42:23,196
- I'll try it on.
- I don't think so.

1579
01:42:23,712 --> 01:42:25,129
Also, I don't think so.

1580
01:42:29,462 --> 01:42:30,337
Brother!

1581
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:34,087
- Me?
- You!

1582
01:42:36,119 --> 01:42:37,587
Didn't you say you wanted
to help?

1583
01:42:38,011 --> 01:42:40,971
Come here. It won't take a minute.

1584
01:42:43,678 --> 01:42:44,879
Lift your arms up.

1585
01:42:45,922 --> 01:42:47,754
Now through the straps.

1586
01:42:49,321 --> 01:42:50,337
Go on...

1587
01:42:54,379 --> 01:42:58,046
Very good. Very nice. See?

1588
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:02,754
You look smart.
Buy one for yourself.

1589
01:43:02,879 --> 01:43:04,004
Chintu!

1590
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:06,754
Let me hook it up for you.

1591
01:43:07,238 --> 01:43:09,921
- It isn't working.
- No, no, it'll work.

1592
01:43:10,879 --> 01:43:12,587
It's not staying in place.

1593
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:16,337
It's the hook.

1594
01:43:19,155 --> 01:43:21,087
Look! A perfect fit.

1595
01:43:21,337 --> 01:43:23,546
What the hell is going on?
What is all this?

1596
01:43:23,671 --> 01:43:26,837
Get it off me. I don't want to wear it.
This... this...

1597
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,087
This, this, this!

1598
01:43:30,979 --> 01:43:33,837
This is a bra!

1599
01:43:34,662 --> 01:43:36,004
Short for brassiere!

1600
01:43:36,301 --> 01:43:39,337
I wear one, your mother wears one,
your sister too.

1601
01:43:39,675 --> 01:43:42,296
Your granny wears one. It doesn't
spread Covid. So what's the problem?

1602
01:43:44,414 --> 01:43:45,796
I'll tell you what the problem is.

1603
01:43:46,062 --> 01:43:49,962
Indian women, for centuries,
have washed their husbands' underwear.

1604
01:43:50,211 --> 01:43:52,254
Scrubbing and scrubbing away!

1605
01:43:52,487 --> 01:43:54,924
And you can't touch a bra?

1606
01:43:56,349 --> 01:44:00,966
But you can dance to the song
"What's behind my blouse?"

1607
01:44:01,924 --> 01:44:03,716
Dance your vulgar dance.

1608
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:07,632
But actually saying what's behind
the blouse embarrasses you.

1609
01:44:09,636 --> 01:44:10,719
What's behind the blouse?

1610
01:44:12,577 --> 01:44:13,886
Actually, Aunty,

1611
01:44:14,427 --> 01:44:16,886
I don't touch it out of respect
for laddiz.

1612
01:44:19,094 --> 01:44:23,511
When you stop thinking they're unlike you
- some strange species -

1613
01:44:24,116 --> 01:44:26,261
and treat them as equals,

1614
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:29,469
then you'll be respecting ladies.

1615
01:44:33,735 --> 01:44:36,427
- Show me something else.
- I'll unhook it.

1616
01:44:41,011 --> 01:44:42,677
Done, thank you.

1617
01:44:45,386 --> 01:44:46,844
Yes, Aunty, tell me.

1618
01:44:47,967 --> 01:44:50,852
Do you have the pink one?

1619
01:44:52,677 --> 01:44:53,177
Poonam?

1620
01:44:53,302 --> 01:44:55,219
- Yes, Mummy-ji?
- Has my husband had his breakfast?

1621
01:44:56,511 --> 01:44:58,844
He's had his breakfast
and his pills.

1622
01:45:07,423 --> 01:45:09,302
Hello. Yes.

1623
01:45:12,927 --> 01:45:13,636
What?

1624
01:45:18,469 --> 01:45:20,844
Ladies and gentlemen, please!

1625
01:45:22,427 --> 01:45:25,094
We have a crisis on our hands.
And it's goddamn serious.

1626
01:45:25,344 --> 01:45:27,052
Look, I'll be the first one to admit.

1627
01:45:27,177 --> 01:45:29,136
I knew this ad campaign
was a terrible idea.

1628
01:45:29,386 --> 01:45:31,427
- What?
- But what's done is done, ma'am.

1629
01:45:31,677 --> 01:45:33,927
Women are our greatest consumers.

1630
01:45:34,219 --> 01:45:35,136
Because of this ad,

1631
01:45:35,261 --> 01:45:37,011
'Boycott Dhanlakshmi'
is trending at number 1.

1632
01:45:37,691 --> 01:45:39,011
We must do damage control!

1633
01:45:39,302 --> 01:45:43,094
These female do-gooders
just want the chance to make trouble.

1634
01:45:43,219 --> 01:45:44,261
Sir, please.

1635
01:45:44,469 --> 01:45:48,011
The situation is serious.
I think we should withdraw the ad.

1636
01:45:48,552 --> 01:45:49,844
We have no other option.

1637
01:45:49,964 --> 01:45:51,802
And the loss of millions?

1638
01:45:52,136 --> 01:45:53,761
What are you saying, Tijori?

1639
01:45:54,177 --> 01:45:58,344
In the 80s, this same ad created
a storm.

1640
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:01,266
- Everyone was crazy about it.
- Exactly.

1641
01:46:01,386 --> 01:46:02,636
Hope you're listening, Rocky?

1642
01:46:02,987 --> 01:46:05,844
Ma'am, that was the 80s.
We're now in 2023.

1643
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:07,602
Our share price is down.

1644
01:46:07,969 --> 01:46:10,615
We must at least admit we made
a mistake.

1645
01:46:11,758 --> 01:46:13,059
Put out an apology.

1646
01:46:19,408 --> 01:46:20,809
Just a minute!

1647
01:46:21,836 --> 01:46:23,711
Is this a fish market?

1648
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:29,336
Calm down. Let's see why the ad
has made everyone so angry.

1649
01:46:29,461 --> 01:46:30,211
Play it!

1650
01:46:31,446 --> 01:46:32,169
Show us!

1651
01:46:35,336 --> 01:46:36,628
Pushpa!

1652
01:46:37,086 --> 01:46:38,336
Jaya!

1653
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:40,169
Roopa!

1654
01:46:40,586 --> 01:46:43,461
At dawn rises the traditional wife.

1655
01:46:44,111 --> 01:46:47,253
She asks her husband,
what he'll eat today.

1656
01:46:47,561 --> 01:46:48,711
What will you have?

1657
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:52,086
For years the answer
has always been the same -

1658
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:55,878
How could anyone forget
the taste of...

1659
01:46:56,211 --> 01:46:58,961
Dhanlakshmi laddoo!

1660
01:46:59,317 --> 01:47:02,461
For me and for you!

1661
01:47:03,152 --> 01:47:05,419
From our kitchen to your kitchen.

1662
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:06,836
Dhanlakshmi Sweets.

1663
01:47:07,065 --> 01:47:09,503
Eating them makes you burst with joy.

1664
01:47:09,725 --> 01:47:13,110
For me and for you!

1665
01:47:13,649 --> 01:47:15,211
It's terrific!

1666
01:47:15,794 --> 01:47:17,044
Are you serious?

1667
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:20,711
- Baby? What'r you doing here?
- I'm so sorry.

1668
01:47:20,836 --> 01:47:22,503
You didn't answer my call.
So I came up.

1669
01:47:22,628 --> 01:47:23,753
It's OK.

1670
01:47:23,878 --> 01:47:25,753
Come, there's no problem.

1671
01:47:25,878 --> 01:47:26,794
I'm really sorry.

1672
01:47:27,611 --> 01:47:29,669
- Miss Rani Chatterjee?
- Yes.

1673
01:47:30,501 --> 01:47:31,836
My staddy GF.

1674
01:47:32,544 --> 01:47:34,586
You not like this advertise?

1675
01:47:37,961 --> 01:47:38,794
No.

1676
01:47:39,542 --> 01:47:40,544
What's issue?

1677
01:47:42,759 --> 01:47:46,294
It's so outdated. I'm not surprised women
are boycotting the brand.

1678
01:47:46,419 --> 01:47:48,878
To be very honest, it is sexist,
it is regressive...

1679
01:47:49,003 --> 01:47:50,253
That's what you think.

1680
01:47:50,961 --> 01:47:52,836
Uncle, it's what your consumers
think too.

1681
01:47:54,044 --> 01:47:57,003
Excuse me. If I could ask Miss Chatterjee
to elaborate?

1682
01:47:57,378 --> 01:47:59,419
After all, she's the woman of today

1683
01:47:59,544 --> 01:48:01,586
- and represents our ideal consumer base.
- This guy...

1684
01:48:01,836 --> 01:48:03,253
If the board won't object...

1685
01:48:03,378 --> 01:48:05,961
- No, no. I really shouldn't.
- Why would we object?

1686
01:48:07,086 --> 01:48:09,461
We've seen the wind changing
many times.

1687
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:14,711
But those winds cannot change
Dhanlakshmi.

1688
01:48:15,326 --> 01:48:16,003
Yes!

1689
01:48:17,003 --> 01:48:20,294
With all due respect, the wind
and the times have changed.

1690
01:48:21,544 --> 01:48:23,669
Perhaps it's time for Dhanlakshmi
to change.

1691
01:48:24,169 --> 01:48:25,253
What you meanz?

1692
01:48:26,253 --> 01:48:30,294
I mean making laddoos
or cooking a meal at home

1693
01:48:30,544 --> 01:48:34,169
is no longer only the woman's job,
then why must the ad say that?

1694
01:48:34,669 --> 01:48:35,794
That's right!

1695
01:48:36,078 --> 01:48:37,253
I mean...

1696
01:48:37,628 --> 01:48:39,461
So according to you,
what must this ad say?

1697
01:48:40,657 --> 01:48:42,961
What do you mean? According to me?
I'm no expert.

1698
01:48:43,086 --> 01:48:43,983
Tell us.

1699
01:48:44,103 --> 01:48:46,503
I'm just saying,
think of something new.

1700
01:48:46,628 --> 01:48:48,461
- Something new?
- Why only women?

1701
01:48:48,581 --> 01:48:50,086
Men can serve laddoos too.

1702
01:48:50,253 --> 01:48:52,878
It's almost like...
"New thinking, great old taste."

1703
01:48:56,537 --> 01:48:59,461
That's an excellent line.
That works!

1704
01:49:05,443 --> 01:49:08,419
"New thinking, great old taste."

1705
01:49:09,416 --> 01:49:10,669
Hashtag!

1706
01:49:13,078 --> 01:49:14,003
What do you say, Papa?

1707
01:49:30,628 --> 01:49:33,794
I come here on Sundays
so that I'm not disturbed.

1708
01:49:35,628 --> 01:49:36,461
Come.

1709
01:49:37,253 --> 01:49:38,961
I could help you.

1710
01:49:49,461 --> 01:49:53,961
These laddoos... press too hard
or too softly,

1711
01:49:54,617 --> 01:49:57,628
and they fall apart.
Like relationships.

1712
01:49:58,586 --> 01:50:02,753
When I was 7, I made a laddoo
for the first time with my grandma.

1713
01:50:03,336 --> 01:50:06,419
From that day on making laddoos
has made me happy.

1714
01:50:08,963 --> 01:50:09,753
What is it?

1715
01:50:10,378 --> 01:50:11,794
It's just so inspiring.

1716
01:50:12,461 --> 01:50:16,169
You're as passionate about
your work as ever. And ambitious.

1717
01:50:16,356 --> 01:50:17,878
In that sense, we're so alike.

1718
01:50:21,385 --> 01:50:26,253
Your idea for the ad was good.
Thank you.

1719
01:50:26,484 --> 01:50:27,753
No, please, don't thank me.

1720
01:50:28,003 --> 01:50:30,044
No, no. You deserve to be thanked.

1721
01:50:30,378 --> 01:50:34,003
You're our guest for just a few days,
yet you've been so helpful.

1722
01:50:36,326 --> 01:50:37,503
You deserve a thank you.

1723
01:50:39,856 --> 01:50:40,836
Pardon?

1724
01:50:42,628 --> 01:50:45,419
You and I are not alike.

1725
01:50:46,945 --> 01:50:48,378
Nor will we ever be.

1726
01:50:50,024 --> 01:50:54,419
For you, you come first.
For me, the family does.

1727
01:50:56,003 --> 01:50:58,961
You can make the ad or a laddoo,

1728
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:01,378
you can't make ties
with this family.

1729
01:51:08,753 --> 01:51:11,628
Who told you family isn't important
to me?

1730
01:51:12,794 --> 01:51:16,753
Family and relationships are equally
important for a career woman.

1731
01:51:17,419 --> 01:51:18,753
Who knows that better than you?

1732
01:51:19,442 --> 01:51:22,961
Your empire is even named after you:
"Dhanlakshmi Sweets".

1733
01:51:24,452 --> 01:51:26,461
And about making lasting ties,

1734
01:51:26,669 --> 01:51:28,878
where hearts are one,
ties will be made too.

1735
01:51:30,586 --> 01:51:32,919
Because the heart heeds no one.

1736
01:51:38,465 --> 01:51:39,102
Game on!

1737
01:51:39,287 --> 01:51:40,970
Rani, Rani! I am Rani

1738
01:51:41,194 --> 01:51:42,962
The girl who knows it all

1739
01:51:43,082 --> 01:51:47,094
Argue and you'll look foolishly small

1740
01:51:47,607 --> 01:51:49,212
Do you think you can beat me?

1741
01:51:49,522 --> 01:51:51,211
Don't you know I'm the queen bee?

1742
01:51:51,446 --> 01:51:53,059
Do you think you can beat me?

1743
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:54,897
Don't you know I'm the queen bee?

1744
01:52:16,003 --> 01:52:17,794
A tsunami of tweets.

1745
01:52:18,253 --> 01:52:21,628
The shares are up and up.
Number one viral trend all India!

1746
01:52:22,336 --> 01:52:23,961
And all thanks to you.

1747
01:52:24,727 --> 01:52:28,378
Without you, Dhanlakshmi Sweets
would've turned bitter.

1748
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,753
Just see what the press is saying:

1749
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:35,461
"Dhanlakshmi make a powerful and
progressive statement in new ad."

1750
01:52:36,455 --> 01:52:39,836
I understand what 'powerful' is.
But what is 'progressive'?

1751
01:52:43,253 --> 01:52:46,211
- You really are unique!
- Whatever I am, I'm yours.

1752
01:52:46,457 --> 01:52:49,794
Let's celebrate!

1753
01:52:50,419 --> 01:52:53,253
We're going to celebrate
at Vicky and Minty's sangeet.

1754
01:52:54,405 --> 01:52:56,600
Sister is getting married

1755
01:52:56,873 --> 01:52:59,886
Sister is getting married

1756
01:53:06,089 --> 01:53:08,336
Sister is getting married

1757
01:53:08,669 --> 01:53:11,044
Valcome, Chatterjees.
The original families are here.

1758
01:53:11,164 --> 01:53:13,919
Aunty, I know you miss me.
Hi, Rani.

1759
01:53:14,544 --> 01:53:16,317
- How I look? You like?
- Very good.

1760
01:53:16,437 --> 01:53:19,669
Let's say hallo to my family.

1761
01:53:20,669 --> 01:53:22,044
The Chatterjees are here.

1762
01:53:22,453 --> 01:53:24,919
Grandpa, the Chatterjees are here.

1763
01:53:26,586 --> 01:53:27,586
Namaste.

1764
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:30,544
Kanwal-ji, how are you?

1765
01:53:31,169 --> 01:53:32,961
You came, Jamini.

1766
01:53:40,211 --> 01:53:41,503
I'll be right back.

1767
01:53:44,253 --> 01:53:46,211
Let me show them to their seats.

1768
01:53:48,793 --> 01:53:50,461
No problem. We're all family.

1769
01:53:50,586 --> 01:53:53,878
You'll sit near the cooler.
I'm sending over a waiter.

1770
01:53:54,491 --> 01:53:57,719
I'd gone away for 12 years,
when I came back I brought a car.

1771
01:53:58,006 --> 01:54:00,844
I'd gone away for 12 years,
when I came back I brought a car.

1772
01:54:00,964 --> 01:54:02,496
Let's start the party

1773
01:54:03,103 --> 01:54:05,338
Grandma Dhanlakshmi!

1774
01:54:06,003 --> 01:54:08,628
- Granny, please!
- Why are they after her?

1775
01:54:09,211 --> 01:54:12,157
Granny, dance with us!

1776
01:54:12,277 --> 01:54:13,924
Granny, dance with us!

1777
01:54:14,044 --> 01:54:16,253
Granny, Granny, Granny.

1778
01:54:27,307 --> 01:54:30,461
Look, I don't know how to dance.
I'm sorry.

1779
01:54:30,836 --> 01:54:33,669
But there's a great artist here today,

1780
01:54:33,953 --> 01:54:36,794
if he dances for us,
it will be our honour.

1781
01:54:37,586 --> 01:54:42,711
Calcutta's famous dancer,
Mr. Chandon Chatterjee.

1782
01:54:43,253 --> 01:54:44,378
Come!

1783
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,878
Sir, please come to the stage.

1784
01:54:56,169 --> 01:54:56,794
One second.

1785
01:54:56,919 --> 01:54:58,336
Papa, this isn't right.

1786
01:54:58,628 --> 01:55:01,253
Come, please come onto the stage.

1787
01:55:03,258 --> 01:55:05,794
A big round of applause

1788
01:55:06,211 --> 01:55:08,586
to welcome on stage, Chandon-ji!

1789
01:55:10,628 --> 01:55:12,711
Long live our Chandon uncle!

1790
01:55:15,619 --> 01:55:17,419
Wonderful!

1791
01:55:19,169 --> 01:55:22,419
Dhanlakshmi-ji, I'd like to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

1792
01:55:23,297 --> 01:55:25,253
What an opportunity!
What a great audience.

1793
01:55:26,952 --> 01:55:29,253
Nothing could please an artist more.

1794
01:55:31,544 --> 01:55:32,419
Come on.

1795
01:55:32,544 --> 01:55:34,503
What music can you play to dance
the Kathak?

1796
01:55:34,628 --> 01:55:39,253
The Kathak? You're a Bengali,
so a 'Devdas' song is a must.

1797
01:55:41,379 --> 01:55:44,508
- DJ, play a song from 'Devdas'.
- So typical.

1798
01:55:44,628 --> 01:55:48,982
Another big round of applause
for Chandon-ji!

1799
01:56:25,822 --> 01:56:29,601
Two and a half evenings have stopped,
have stopped, have stopped

1800
01:56:29,721 --> 01:56:33,587
Two and a half evenings have stopped,
and you playfully kissed me

1801
01:56:34,305 --> 01:56:37,232
You playfully kissed me,
you playfully kissed me

1802
01:56:37,352 --> 01:56:41,110
My scarf slipped away from my head,
went away, went away

1803
01:56:41,230 --> 01:56:46,513
My scarf slipped away from my head,
sliding, sliding, sliding

1804
01:56:49,083 --> 01:56:55,872
Why do you tease and provoke me,
making my heart dance

1805
01:56:56,869 --> 01:57:00,268
Why do you tease and provoke me

1806
01:57:22,179 --> 01:57:23,739
What kind of dance is this?

1807
01:58:00,071 --> 01:58:00,972
Uncle...

1808
01:58:03,329 --> 01:58:06,218
I... wanted to say sorry.

1809
01:58:09,164 --> 01:58:10,301
It's OK.

1810
01:58:13,385 --> 01:58:14,718
I'm used to it.

1811
01:58:16,718 --> 01:58:18,510
The first time

1812
01:58:19,924 --> 01:58:21,843
I told my father

1813
01:58:22,874 --> 01:58:25,093
I wanted to learn Kathak,

1814
01:58:25,983 --> 01:58:27,801
he made fun of me too.

1815
01:58:29,295 --> 01:58:32,676
When I insisted, he got furious.

1816
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,218
He even hit...

1817
01:58:41,111 --> 01:58:43,176
When I joined Kathak classes,

1818
01:58:44,785 --> 01:58:48,260
I was the only male student there.

1819
01:58:50,498 --> 01:58:54,510
All my friends became engineers
and doctors.

1820
01:58:56,331 --> 01:59:00,343
I told everyone I was going to be
a professional Kathak dancer.

1821
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:07,635
They made so much fun of me
behind my back, saying

1822
01:59:08,981 --> 01:59:11,468
"That bloody loser."

1823
01:59:14,977 --> 01:59:16,343
I won't lie.

1824
01:59:16,855 --> 01:59:18,760
It makes a difference.

1825
01:59:20,343 --> 01:59:24,885
I'm a human being...
it's hurtful.

1826
01:59:27,871 --> 01:59:31,968
But I never ever thought
of giving up dancing.

1827
01:59:33,885 --> 01:59:34,593
Know why?

1828
01:59:37,385 --> 01:59:39,093
Because my mother

1829
01:59:40,676 --> 01:59:42,343
always stood by me.

1830
01:59:47,551 --> 01:59:49,128
She said:

1831
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:55,343
"Son, talent has no gender."

1832
02:00:01,801 --> 02:00:03,343
And I live by that.

1833
02:00:15,385 --> 02:00:18,010
I've messed up so badly.

1834
02:00:19,294 --> 02:00:21,265
I stand here before you,

1835
02:00:21,385 --> 02:00:24,551
if I'm to blame for anything else,
tell me.

1836
02:00:25,003 --> 02:00:28,385
Why use swear words that insult women?
What misogyny!

1837
02:00:28,505 --> 02:00:30,676
So I can't swear now?

1838
02:00:30,992 --> 02:00:34,800
Aunty, I'm from Delhi.
How can I not swear?

1839
02:00:35,705 --> 02:00:36,960
What times we live in!

1840
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,385
Can't call fat people 'fat.'
Can't call Black people 'black.'

1841
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:42,718
Can't call the old, 'old.'
Scared to open my mouth.

1842
02:00:42,962 --> 02:00:45,146
Can I call Chinese food
'Chinese'?

1843
02:00:46,558 --> 02:00:48,801
What if I'm ordering Chinese,
what do I say?

1844
02:00:48,921 --> 02:00:52,051
Should I say? "Yes, sir. The place
right of Himanchal.

1845
02:00:52,171 --> 02:00:54,885
"Our neighbour! The Corona guys.

1846
02:00:55,010 --> 02:00:56,926
"Yes, I want a Crispy Chicken."

1847
02:00:58,676 --> 02:01:01,176
Now you'll say, I can't say
'Corona guys'.

1848
02:01:03,635 --> 02:01:06,260
Since I was a small boy,
my grandma said:

1849
02:01:06,385 --> 02:01:08,926
"Drinking tea darkens the skin."

1850
02:01:09,249 --> 02:01:10,885
Now I realise this is racist.

1851
02:01:11,385 --> 02:01:14,635
No one told me some swear words
are missaaginy.

1852
02:01:14,909 --> 02:01:18,510
They didn't tell me calling my sister
'Golu' was fat-shaming.

1853
02:01:19,102 --> 02:01:20,718
Talking like that felt normal.

1854
02:01:21,510 --> 02:01:23,343
Never thought it was wrong.

1855
02:01:23,644 --> 02:01:26,968
Never knew I'd be hurting someone
if I used such words.

1856
02:01:30,171 --> 02:01:31,218
Tell me.

1857
02:01:31,764 --> 02:01:35,093
What would you call the words
you've used to describe me?

1858
02:01:36,051 --> 02:01:39,676
Rocky doesn't know how to turn on
the gas stove. Whattey shame!

1859
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,051
Rocky doesn't know men can also
go bra shopping. Whattey shame!

1860
02:01:43,171 --> 02:01:46,051
Rocky doesn't know men can dance
Kathak. Whattey shame!

1861
02:01:46,339 --> 02:01:48,343
And what's the biggest shame?

1862
02:01:48,598 --> 02:01:53,093
Rocky doesn't know English.
Whattebad! Whatteworst!

1863
02:01:54,385 --> 02:01:56,176
All confirmed, he's cancelled.

1864
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,968
I'm no one to talk. But I will say,

1865
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:05,593
if we keep cancelling each other,

1866
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:08,218
we'll never learn anything in life.

1867
02:02:11,078 --> 02:02:15,343
I thought if I came here, I could win
your hearts. But what's with you all?

1868
02:02:15,468 --> 02:02:18,593
No one will hug me,
or touch me.

1869
02:02:18,718 --> 02:02:20,718
You laugh at the way I speak.

1870
02:02:20,838 --> 02:02:23,969
You're ashamed to introduce me
to your friends.

1871
02:02:25,622 --> 02:02:27,887
You think I'm blind to your attitude?

1872
02:02:28,251 --> 02:02:30,718
That I can't feel? That it doesn't
hurt?

1873
02:02:35,984 --> 02:02:40,510
How can you shame me? I'm so ashamed
of myself anyway.

1874
02:02:41,578 --> 02:02:43,051
And especially today.

1875
02:02:43,988 --> 02:02:45,010
Uncle,

1876
02:02:46,741 --> 02:02:49,801
by God, I'm touched by the things
you said.

1877
02:02:51,292 --> 02:02:54,125
Did you know dancing makes me
happy too?

1878
02:02:55,852 --> 02:02:59,334
But I don't have the guts
to dance in front of my family.

1879
02:03:01,003 --> 02:03:03,214
My father has a problem
with me dancing.

1880
02:03:03,447 --> 02:03:05,292
I could never challenge him.

1881
02:03:07,735 --> 02:03:12,334
I have never fought for
my own happiness. I'm a big loser.

1882
02:03:16,049 --> 02:03:19,000
I respect you deeply, uncle.

1883
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,334
I'm sorry.

1884
02:03:29,858 --> 02:03:32,584
You gave me a place in your home.

1885
02:03:34,875 --> 02:03:36,167
Thanks a lot.

1886
02:03:41,293 --> 02:03:42,250
God bless.

1887
02:03:42,943 --> 02:03:44,000
Rocky.

1888
02:03:56,922 --> 02:03:58,042
Won't you give me a hug?

1889
02:04:00,548 --> 02:04:01,292
Cuddle?

1890
02:04:22,834 --> 02:04:24,875
Baba! You OK?
I've been calling you for hours.

1891
02:04:25,417 --> 02:04:26,209
Baba,

1892
02:04:27,389 --> 02:04:30,417
I think I should come home.
I don't think this is working.

1893
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:34,834
No, Rani. You must stay there.

1894
02:04:35,125 --> 02:04:37,619
Baba, how?
They were making fun of you.

1895
02:04:38,638 --> 02:04:42,459
Forget that. Rocky was too.
That's not OK, Baba.

1896
02:04:44,189 --> 02:04:45,209
Didn't we laugh at Rocky?

1897
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:47,542
Didn't you?

1898
02:04:49,167 --> 02:04:51,917
He isn't perfect, neither are we.

1899
02:04:54,043 --> 02:04:56,250
You think love is perfect, Rani?

1900
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:58,084
Well?

1901
02:05:01,799 --> 02:05:06,084
From this body of mine

1902
02:05:07,246 --> 02:05:10,890
Veiling the soul and spirit

1903
02:05:12,667 --> 02:05:17,250
A punishment? Or a blessing?

1904
02:05:18,367 --> 02:05:21,209
Are these stories of love

1905
02:05:22,333 --> 02:05:25,667
OK, students! Ready?

1906
02:05:41,641 --> 02:05:45,263
- To show respect we bow mid-way.
- But respect must be all the way.

1907
02:05:45,383 --> 02:05:49,724
O crazy one!

1908
02:05:50,432 --> 02:05:55,176
- O crazy one! O naïve heart of mine
- Come on, let's start.

1909
02:05:55,887 --> 02:06:00,031
O crazy one!

1910
02:06:01,345 --> 02:06:05,707
O crazy one! O naïve heart of mine

1911
02:06:07,221 --> 02:06:11,108
You lose yourself in love

1912
02:06:12,741 --> 02:06:16,657
Never to be found again

1913
02:06:17,495 --> 02:06:20,555
I'm learning how to make
an Americano from YouTube.

1914
02:06:20,821 --> 02:06:23,292
You chose a cage over the open sky

1915
02:06:23,568 --> 02:06:27,125
Refusing the chance to break free

1916
02:06:28,165 --> 02:06:30,540
Why are you so obsessed
with crypto?

1917
02:06:30,851 --> 02:06:31,999
You'll make a profit...

1918
02:06:34,207 --> 02:06:35,665
I'll call you back...

1919
02:06:36,122 --> 02:06:38,499
How long will you trade
in secret, Gayatri?

1920
02:06:39,283 --> 02:06:42,040
You're so good. Do it professionally.

1921
02:06:42,991 --> 02:06:44,249
- Professionally?
- Yes.

1922
02:06:45,149 --> 02:06:46,207
Impossible.

1923
02:06:46,651 --> 02:06:48,790
Gayatri, it's time you gain confidence.

1924
02:06:49,688 --> 02:06:51,650
And if you need any help,
I'm here. OK?

1925
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:56,207
Go, fall in love if you must.
Be stubborn if you must

1926
02:06:56,327 --> 02:06:59,883
O crazy one!

1927
02:07:01,766 --> 02:07:04,837
In love you will find
you'll be left with nothing

1928
02:07:04,957 --> 02:07:06,749
Here it comes.

1929
02:07:08,038 --> 02:07:09,249
One more...

1930
02:07:10,132 --> 02:07:11,392
Enough, Rani.

1931
02:07:11,722 --> 02:07:12,832
He remembers your name?

1932
02:07:13,276 --> 02:07:14,457
He uses it sometimes.

1933
02:07:15,584 --> 02:07:19,232
- He hasn't called my name in years.
- Will you feed him?

1934
02:07:19,414 --> 02:07:23,006
Ignoring yourself, you heed the other

1935
02:07:23,126 --> 02:07:27,734
Is this love? Or a blunder?

1936
02:07:28,397 --> 02:07:33,859
If this is a blessing,
then why the punishment?

1937
02:07:33,979 --> 02:07:38,364
A moment's attachment

1938
02:07:39,511 --> 02:07:43,756
Will make you sleepless forever

1939
02:07:44,767 --> 02:07:49,329
Heed the words of the selfish

1940
02:07:50,829 --> 02:07:55,348
Who find the goal they seek

1941
02:07:56,425 --> 02:07:59,836
The easy way was never your way

1942
02:08:01,739 --> 02:08:05,565
If the world curses, let it curse

1943
02:08:07,289 --> 02:08:11,129
Never count your suffering

1944
02:08:12,093 --> 02:08:15,896
So have your way

1945
02:08:17,684 --> 02:08:21,736
O crazy one! O naïve heart of mine

1946
02:08:34,906 --> 02:08:36,653
Straight from the heart!

1947
02:08:41,005 --> 02:08:47,008
If they do not heed your call,
walk alone

1948
02:08:47,885 --> 02:08:54,124
If they do not heed your call,
walk alone

1949
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:58,056
Walk alone, walk alone

1950
02:09:00,477 --> 02:09:06,023
If they do not heed your call,
walk alone

1951
02:09:14,905 --> 02:09:17,401
Rani has become so close to Papa-ji.

1952
02:09:17,642 --> 02:09:19,407
He listens only to her now.

1953
02:09:20,113 --> 02:09:22,117
I am a stranger to him.

1954
02:09:23,582 --> 02:09:27,059
You weren't permitted to show him
that you cared for him.

1955
02:09:27,284 --> 02:09:31,264
O crazy one

1956
02:09:32,732 --> 02:09:36,231
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

1957
02:09:38,687 --> 02:09:43,403
Go, fall in love if you must.
Be stubborn if you must

1958
02:09:44,142 --> 02:09:46,177
O crazy one

1959
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:54,504
In love you will find
you'll be left with nothing

1960
02:09:55,046 --> 02:09:57,516
O crazy one

1961
02:10:00,498 --> 02:10:05,723
Go, fall in love if you must.
Be stubborn if you must

1962
02:10:05,843 --> 02:10:08,013
O crazy one

1963
02:10:11,276 --> 02:10:16,326
In love you will find
you'll be left with nothing

1964
02:10:16,743 --> 02:10:18,755
O crazy one

1965
02:10:31,625 --> 02:10:33,955
- Talent Contest, wild card entry!
- What?

1966
02:10:34,173 --> 02:10:37,830
I took a chance and videoed you
the other day. You've been selected!

1967
02:10:38,585 --> 02:10:40,744
Your audition is on Saturday at 7.
See?

1968
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:46,705
What's wrong?

1969
02:10:47,867 --> 02:10:49,372
How dare you?

1970
02:10:50,997 --> 02:10:53,039
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Happy?

1971
02:10:53,518 --> 02:10:56,039
You can be a rebel.
But do you want me hung?

1972
02:10:56,376 --> 02:10:57,414
What do you want?

1973
02:10:57,642 --> 02:10:59,039
I don't want anything, I...

1974
02:11:00,542 --> 02:11:01,789
Actually, that's a lie.

1975
02:11:03,026 --> 02:11:06,830
I want you to show yourself
the love and respect you show others.

1976
02:11:07,574 --> 02:11:10,032
Give yourself a chance
to be happy.

1977
02:11:10,157 --> 02:11:14,866
Don't be a symbol of weakness
but strength for Gayatri.

1978
02:11:14,991 --> 02:11:16,407
That's what I want.

1979
02:11:17,866 --> 02:11:22,949
Ma, the Rana Mart owners are coming
to see me on Saturday.

1980
02:11:24,334 --> 02:11:27,186
Grandma says they've approved
my full length photographs.

1981
02:11:27,449 --> 02:11:28,657
And what did you say?

1982
02:11:32,577 --> 02:11:34,736
This is called a spine.

1983
02:11:34,992 --> 02:11:37,616
You can't buy one. You must use
the one you have.

1984
02:11:45,532 --> 02:11:48,074
Ah, here's the tea.
And so is Golu.

1985
02:11:48,907 --> 02:11:50,032
Come, child.

1986
02:11:52,116 --> 02:11:56,324
Yashpal Rana's younger brother,
Gopal Rana. Rana and Rana.

1987
02:11:58,032 --> 02:11:59,041
Some tea?

1988
02:11:59,303 --> 02:12:01,366
We're not here to drink tea.

1989
02:12:02,074 --> 02:12:04,157
We've come to see the girl.

1990
02:12:04,657 --> 02:12:07,116
Well, my little Rana! You like her?

1991
02:12:07,991 --> 02:12:09,185
Like her?

1992
02:12:11,116 --> 02:12:12,157
He's shy.

1993
02:12:13,407 --> 02:12:14,949
We like your daughter.

1994
02:12:15,449 --> 02:12:16,386
Congrats!

1995
02:12:17,741 --> 02:12:20,116
We wanted a plumpy girl like her.

1996
02:12:21,324 --> 02:12:22,941
Why keep it from you?

1997
02:12:23,157 --> 02:12:26,574
Yashpal's first wife was Miss Noida.

1998
02:12:27,157 --> 02:12:30,981
The whole neighbourhood eyed her up,
and she eyed them back.

1999
02:12:31,949 --> 02:12:33,366
Divorced in two months.

2000
02:12:34,657 --> 02:12:37,199
That's why we like your girl.

2001
02:12:38,532 --> 02:12:41,324
So we don't make the same mistake twice.

2002
02:12:42,782 --> 02:12:43,741
Well, child?

2003
02:12:43,866 --> 02:12:45,329
Any hobbies?

2004
02:12:45,449 --> 02:12:50,445
Cooking, cleaning, embroidery,
painting...?

2005
02:12:50,792 --> 02:12:52,449
Answer the question, Golu.

2006
02:12:57,462 --> 02:12:59,199
- Yes, singing.
- Singing?

2007
02:13:00,199 --> 02:13:00,949
Since when?

2008
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:04,282
If you don't mind, can I sing for you?

2009
02:13:04,524 --> 02:13:07,991
Sing! Join in the rhythm!

2010
02:13:08,116 --> 02:13:09,032
Yes.

2011
02:13:17,688 --> 02:13:22,449
Why do you cover your face
with that long veil?

2012
02:13:22,866 --> 02:13:27,074
Girl, did you bring shame on us?

2013
02:13:27,782 --> 02:13:31,324
My brother-in-law was sleeping
on the roof terrace

2014
02:13:31,532 --> 02:13:35,852
I thought it was you
and lay down beside him

2015
02:13:36,764 --> 02:13:39,824
Mr. Rana, forgive me

2016
02:13:40,418 --> 02:13:42,741
I made a little mistake

2017
02:13:42,935 --> 02:13:46,420
Gupchup. Gupchup. Gupchup.

2018
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:51,322
You insolent girl!

2019
02:13:52,157 --> 02:13:55,443
You're behind what happened today. You!

2020
02:13:56,157 --> 02:13:58,657
It wasn't Golu, it was her.

2021
02:13:59,251 --> 02:14:00,907
- It was me.
- Golu...

2022
02:14:01,032 --> 02:14:02,324
My name is not Golu.

2023
02:14:02,991 --> 02:14:04,991
My name is Gayatri. Gayatri!

2024
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,922
I put on 20 kilos,

2025
02:14:08,199 --> 02:14:10,699
and you made me lose
all my self-respect.

2026
02:14:11,349 --> 02:14:14,615
Did you ever wonder why my words
come out wrong?

2027
02:14:14,782 --> 02:14:17,287
Why I can't speak properly?
Why call me "Golu"?

2028
02:14:17,407 --> 02:14:19,532
Why "Golu?" Ever thought about it?

2029
02:14:21,311 --> 02:14:23,741
All this is because of you.

2030
02:14:24,116 --> 02:14:29,070
You think I'm round like a
Dhanlakshmi ladoo, ready to sell.

2031
02:14:31,157 --> 02:14:33,241
It's enough. More than enough!

2032
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:39,325
I'm going to work
at India Now Network.

2033
02:14:40,074 --> 02:14:43,657
And I'll marry, if and when
I feel like it.

2034
02:14:43,782 --> 02:14:47,407
Given my legacy, marriage
seems impossible, to be honest.

2035
02:14:49,796 --> 02:14:50,824
My respects.

2036
02:14:54,282 --> 02:14:55,366
Seven o'clock!

2037
02:14:56,664 --> 02:14:57,866
Seven o'clock!

2038
02:15:00,366 --> 02:15:01,199
It's seven!

2039
02:15:06,022 --> 02:15:07,074
It's seven!

2040
02:15:08,213 --> 02:15:09,074
What's going on?

2041
02:15:15,491 --> 02:15:18,282
Aunty. Aunty, one second.

2042
02:15:23,071 --> 02:15:24,147
All the best!

2043
02:15:34,991 --> 02:15:36,741
Poonam, I'm getting late.

2044
02:15:36,866 --> 02:15:38,866
- Listen, please.
- Yes?

2045
02:15:38,991 --> 02:15:41,616
Rani's family organises a grand
Durga Prayer every year...

2046
02:15:41,741 --> 02:15:43,616
- We are not going.
- They've invited us.

2047
02:15:43,741 --> 02:15:45,116
I said we are not going.

2048
02:15:45,369 --> 02:15:49,032
If not for our sake,
then for the Goddess?

2049
02:16:00,324 --> 02:16:01,991
Hail Ma Durga!

2050
02:16:02,394 --> 02:16:04,116
Hail Ma Durga!

2051
02:16:08,678 --> 02:16:12,157
Season's greetings to you all.

2052
02:16:12,445 --> 02:16:15,324
And welcome to CCAD.

Chittoronjon Cultural
Association Durgotsav.

2054
02:16:19,336 --> 02:16:23,782
As you know, every Maha Astami
we perform a dance here.

2055
02:16:24,625 --> 02:16:25,657
But not this year.

2056
02:16:26,458 --> 02:16:30,324
Today we'll deviate a little
from our traditional format.

2057
02:16:30,925 --> 02:16:34,469
Breaking our anti-Bollywood
stance,

2058
02:16:34,803 --> 02:16:38,136
we bring you a unique performance.

2059
02:16:46,803 --> 02:16:48,053
Go, Baba!

2060
02:16:57,261 --> 02:17:00,594
Let us dance, let us sway.

2061
02:17:19,053 --> 02:17:21,969
Let us dance, let us sway.

2062
02:17:26,413 --> 02:17:29,945
Let us dance, let us sway.

2063
02:17:33,838 --> 02:17:37,136
All eyes are on me.
Let lightning strike

2064
02:17:37,710 --> 02:17:40,905
Lightning, lightning.
Let lightning strike

2065
02:17:41,186 --> 02:17:44,431
All eyes are on me.
Let lightning strike

2066
02:17:44,698 --> 02:17:47,886
I will tie my dancing bells
to my ankles

2067
02:17:48,308 --> 02:17:51,420
I will tie my dancing bells
to my ankles

2068
02:17:51,694 --> 02:17:55,137
And I will dance, I will rejoice

2069
02:17:55,506 --> 02:17:58,719
Let us dance, let us sway.

2070
02:18:02,818 --> 02:18:06,046
Let us dance, let us sway.

I didn't do anything.

He insulted my family.

- Like your women folk do?
- Don't drag them into this.

When he was dragging my family
into this, where were you?

2140
02:24:20,347 --> 02:24:23,388
One second. I have a problem
with my father too.

But I thought we shouldn't argue
on a festival day.

You told me to talk to him.
So let me handle it.

You can't even be upfront with him,

I know his ways, but I ignore them,
because I respect my elders.

Keep your phony respect.

Elders should be worthy of respect.
I can't bear you humiliating my father.

Likewise.

02:24:50,479 --> 02:24:52,930
You should not have raised
your hand.

2150
02:24:54,305 --> 02:24:55,680
Your family must've taught you that.

2151
02:24:57,388 --> 02:24:59,305
And you're right.
We are very different.

No matter how much we try,

Whatever the provocation,
why raise your hand?

2164

I didn't.

You were there. You saw what happened!

Yes, Rani, I saw. But your father
is right.

Of all people, you're taking
Rocky's side, Ma?

2169
02:26:04,786 --> 02:26:07,430
I have no qualms in admitting
that I was wrong about him.

2170
02:26:07,757 --> 02:26:09,055
Are you crazy?

2171
02:26:09,614 --> 02:26:11,513
After all, he is his father's son.

2172
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:13,560
And his mother's.

2173
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:17,602
- Aren't you being patriarchal now?
- Yes, he's his mother's son,

2174
02:26:17,722 --> 02:26:21,222
but he never stood by his mother.
As if he'd stand by me.

2175
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:24,430
Thakuma, you understand me?

2176
02:26:24,555 --> 02:26:27,602
You said family does the backseat
driving in relationships.

2177

How will I survive? Tell me!

- Rocky isn't like that.
- How do you know?

2179
02:26:35,465 --> 02:26:37,984
Honestly, you shouldn't be giving us advice.
You cheated on grandpa.

Rani!

2181
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:44,138
So I cheated!

2182
02:26:45,597 --> 02:26:49,305
I don't regret it for a minute.

2183
02:26:52,082 --> 02:26:55,874
But I do regret bottling it up

2184
02:26:56,999 --> 02:26:58,707
for all these years.

2185
02:27:02,707 --> 02:27:06,291
Your grandpa used to hit me.

02:27:10,194 --> 02:27:13,082
He'd beat your father with a belt.

2187

wanting to dance.

On the surface, your grandfather
looked so gentle,

but inside, he was another Tijori.

Just as Rocky is unlike his father.

The love I was showered with
in those brief seven days,

2194
02:27:47,749 --> 02:27:52,416
I never got in my long years
of marriage.

2195
02:27:55,416 --> 02:27:59,207
Love was not in my destiny, Rani.

2196
02:28:02,130 --> 02:28:04,416
But it is in yours.

2197
02:28:05,457 --> 02:28:10,957
Decide if you want to become
a 70-year-old Jamini,

2198
02:28:11,416 --> 02:28:14,416
someone who waited for love
all her life.

2199
02:28:17,624 --> 02:28:18,666
Tell me!

2200
02:28:36,082 --> 02:28:38,332
Did you hear what she said?

2201
02:28:38,541 --> 02:28:42,541
I knew she was pure trouble.

2202
02:28:43,707 --> 02:28:47,374
I'll never forget the way
I was humiliated today.

2203
02:28:47,874 --> 02:28:50,166
My humiliation was even greater.

2204
02:28:50,749 --> 02:28:52,332
Hey! Switch the TV off!

2205
02:28:53,249 --> 02:28:58,291
Tijori, you saw how my husband
was running after that Jamini.

2206
02:28:58,874 --> 02:29:02,041
And that Rani has spread poison
in this house.

2221
02:30:05,749 --> 02:30:07,749
Rocky, are you in your right mind?

2222
02:30:12,541 --> 02:30:14,207
For the first time I am, Grandma.

2223
02:30:16,332 --> 02:30:19,124
You know what I learned
in their home?

2224
02:30:20,749 --> 02:30:23,749
The respect I felt for you both,

2225
02:30:26,181 --> 02:30:27,791
was not respect, but fear.

2226
02:30:30,749 --> 02:30:33,624
- I'm not scared anymore.
- Talk politely to your grandma.

2227
02:30:33,749 --> 02:30:35,457
First talk politely to my mother.

2228
02:30:35,791 --> 02:30:38,749
You fool! You dare answer
your father back?

2229
02:30:42,041 --> 02:30:42,999
Father?

2230
02:30:44,749 --> 02:30:47,749
A father who was not a loving son,
how could he be a loving father to me?

2231
02:30:53,291 --> 02:30:54,374
You know, Papa.

2232
02:30:56,259 --> 02:31:00,374
I can't explain how much I love Rani.

2233
02:31:01,749 --> 02:31:07,416
She didn't respect you,
or the elders of my family.

2234
02:31:08,957 --> 02:31:10,749
So I broke off with her.

2235
02:31:13,416 --> 02:31:17,207
I consider my mother like a goddess.

2236
02:31:19,067 --> 02:31:20,416
But you show her no respect.

2237
02:31:25,002 --> 02:31:26,999
So we must part ways.

2238
02:31:32,499 --> 02:31:36,207
I hope you enjoy your grand home,
your business,

2239
02:31:37,495 --> 02:31:43,416
your wealth, your arrogance, Tijori-ji.

2240
02:31:47,666 --> 02:31:49,041
I'm leaving home.

2241
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:53,291
My son will not leave alone.

2242
02:31:53,749 --> 02:31:54,874
Absolutely not.

2243
02:31:56,822 --> 02:31:59,291
You can't be of our blood.

2244
02:32:02,332 --> 02:32:03,457
Wrong, Grandma.

2245
02:32:06,541 --> 02:32:08,332
Your blood does run in my veins,

2246
02:32:10,457 --> 02:32:12,916
but there's no trace of you
in my heart.

2247
02:32:15,666 --> 02:32:16,874
Who are you to me?

2248
02:32:19,666 --> 02:32:22,499
Blood ties and love ties
are not the same.

2249
02:32:25,370 --> 02:32:27,041
Love makes relationships.

2250
02:32:30,770 --> 02:32:33,666
Such a pity you could never love.

2251
02:32:38,124 --> 02:32:40,374
So now you're all alone.

2252
02:32:46,207 --> 02:32:47,666
Now live with yourself.

2253
02:32:54,328 --> 02:32:55,166
Tijori...

2254
02:32:58,471 --> 02:32:59,249
Papa-ji.

2255
02:32:59,725 --> 02:33:00,807
Tijori...

2256
02:33:14,468 --> 02:33:15,999
Papa-ji, you took my name?

2257
02:33:18,496 --> 02:33:19,541
Tijori.

2258
02:33:20,957 --> 02:33:22,039
My son.

2259
02:33:27,166 --> 02:33:28,666
My son.

2260
02:33:31,720 --> 02:33:33,749
Never break up the family.

2261
02:33:35,041 --> 02:33:36,874
Never break up the family.

2262
02:33:38,666 --> 02:33:40,666
Never break up the family.

2263
02:33:50,038 --> 02:33:50,999
Papa-ji!

2264
02:33:51,408 --> 02:33:52,499
Papa-ji!

2265
02:33:53,582 --> 02:33:55,206
- Rocky.
- Grandpa.

2266
02:33:55,326 --> 02:33:56,548
Check his pulse.

2267
02:33:56,791 --> 02:33:59,453
Get the car out! Papa-ji...

2268
02:34:00,146 --> 02:34:02,041
Grandpa's pulse is very weak.

2269
02:34:02,666 --> 02:34:03,999
Nurse!

2270
02:34:07,317 --> 02:34:08,249
Nurse!

2271
02:34:08,874 --> 02:34:09,916
Doctor!

2272
02:34:10,832 --> 02:34:11,916
Doctor!

2273
02:34:55,165 --> 02:34:56,294
Tijori!

2274
02:35:02,591 --> 02:35:08,442
Cry your heart out, Ranjha

2275
02:35:08,947 --> 02:35:14,725
Parted from your Heer

2276
02:35:15,247 --> 02:35:20,899
Cry your heart out

2277
02:35:21,566 --> 02:35:26,712
Cry your heart out, Mirza

2278
02:35:27,816 --> 02:35:33,106
Parted from your Sahiba

2279
02:35:34,219 --> 02:35:36,938
Cry your heart out

2280
02:35:37,353 --> 02:35:39,935
Cry your heart out

2281
02:35:41,003 --> 02:35:44,164
The heartless spider struck

2282
02:35:44,284 --> 02:35:46,950
Spreading its poison

2283
02:35:47,434 --> 02:35:50,245
Listen to our plea, O God!

2284
02:35:50,528 --> 02:35:53,505
Show pity on lovers
who are pulled apart

2285
02:35:53,771 --> 02:35:59,681
All happiness in life is nothing
without my beloved

2286
02:36:00,068 --> 02:36:05,666
No prayer, no balm can heal
this deep affliction

2287
02:36:06,122 --> 02:36:10,458
Swallow your youth

2288
02:36:12,125 --> 02:36:17,248
The two streams that flow
from your eyes

2289
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:25,082
Tijori, tell her to leave.

2290
02:36:28,207 --> 02:36:31,291
Let me say a last goodbye.

2291
02:36:50,971 --> 02:36:53,999
It's Jamini.

2292
02:36:56,164 --> 02:37:01,646
Made of strong clay

2293
02:37:02,596 --> 02:37:08,244
Yet hearts are made of fragile glass

2294
02:37:09,028 --> 02:37:14,022
Those who are fated to break

2295
02:37:15,232 --> 02:37:19,983
do so at your gestures

2296
02:37:22,060 --> 02:37:28,018
Lovers not fated to live
as one

2297
02:37:28,852 --> 02:37:33,977
O Lord, never let them meet

2298
02:37:34,935 --> 02:37:39,852
Why take pleasure in their pain?
When it is nothing to you

2299
02:37:41,124 --> 02:37:45,727
It's all a twist of fate

2300
02:37:46,888 --> 02:37:51,355
Let lovers live

2301
02:37:53,212 --> 02:37:58,444
They don't know the ways of the world

2302
02:37:58,964 --> 02:38:00,683
He was my soulmate.

2303
02:38:02,670 --> 02:38:07,392
Cry your heart out, Ranjha

2304
02:38:08,725 --> 02:38:13,187
Parted from your Heer

2305
02:38:15,428 --> 02:38:18,081
Cry your heart out

2306
02:38:20,693 --> 02:38:21,741
Poonam.

2307
02:38:23,985 --> 02:38:27,027
I know I do not deserve
to be forgiven,

2308
02:38:29,982 --> 02:38:31,277
- but if you can...
- No.

2309
02:38:33,925 --> 02:38:35,069
It's too late.

2310
02:38:36,402 --> 02:38:38,569
You lost the right to say sorry.

2311
02:38:39,684 --> 02:38:42,944
You aren't worthy of respect,
nor is your mother.

2312
02:38:45,624 --> 02:38:48,819
She didn't respect women,
despite being a woman herself.

2313
02:38:50,069 --> 02:38:51,985
What could be worse than that?

2314
02:38:53,777 --> 02:38:55,569
In raising you as the man of the house,

2315
02:38:55,694 --> 02:38:58,319
she forgot you were not only
her son,

2316
02:38:59,693 --> 02:39:01,152
but also your father's son.

2317
02:39:01,277 --> 02:39:03,069
And a father to your children.

2318
02:39:04,979 --> 02:39:08,402
And you are my husband.

2319
02:39:11,139 --> 02:39:13,694
Now you're imprisoned by regret,

2320
02:39:14,902 --> 02:39:15,860
and I am free.

2321
02:39:17,569 --> 02:39:19,652
Be well in your confinement,
Mr. Tijori.

2322
02:39:20,249 --> 02:39:23,860
Disrespectful woman! Is that how you
talk to your husband?

2323
02:39:24,153 --> 02:39:26,319
First learn how to talk
to my wife.

2324
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:31,777
Tijori.

2325
02:39:32,985 --> 02:39:34,652
You dare shout at your mother?

2326
02:39:37,224 --> 02:39:38,527
Is this how I raised you?

2327
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:43,319
Raised me, Mummy?
You hardly did.

2328
02:39:45,745 --> 02:39:50,985
You made me an arrogant man.
That arrogance is hollow.

2329
02:40:00,277 --> 02:40:01,944
You were right, Poonam.

2330
02:40:02,695 --> 02:40:04,527
I'm unworthy of forgiveness.

2331
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:12,235
But I'll try my best to earn
your forgiveness.

2332
02:40:18,069 --> 02:40:19,819
I have lost my father.

2333
02:40:21,903 --> 02:40:23,735
I don't want to lose
my wife and children.

2334
02:40:29,152 --> 02:40:30,777
I will not lose them.

2335
02:40:58,516 --> 02:41:00,569
Thakuma, I'm going out...

2336
02:41:13,985 --> 02:41:15,610
We came here to apologise.

2337
02:41:16,485 --> 02:41:21,319
I'm responsible for all the problems
that have come between us.

2338
02:41:23,747 --> 02:41:26,152
- Forgive me if you can.
- Uncle, please.

2339
02:41:28,402 --> 02:41:31,819
I was wrong to do
and say what I did.

2340
02:41:33,235 --> 02:41:36,819
I insulted our love by insulting you
the other day.

2341
02:41:38,902 --> 02:41:42,902
Rocky may never forgive me,
but you must, uncle. I'm really very sorry.

2342
02:41:43,027 --> 02:41:44,235
No, my dear.

2343
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:55,235
We really want Rocky
to marry into your family.

2344
02:41:57,767 --> 02:41:59,277
If you all agree...

2345
02:42:02,444 --> 02:42:03,944
...and you agree too.

2346
02:42:04,610 --> 02:42:07,527
A heartbroken lover
waits for you outside.

2347
02:42:08,665 --> 02:42:14,405
How long will you be cross with me?

2348
02:42:15,776 --> 02:42:21,451
I'll hold you close
so you won't stay mad at me

2349
02:42:22,859 --> 02:42:25,606
Since the day we met

2350
02:42:26,453 --> 02:42:28,860
Since the day we met

2351
02:42:29,877 --> 02:42:32,737
I'm no longer me

2352
02:42:33,582 --> 02:42:36,177
Since the day we met

2353
02:42:37,128 --> 02:42:40,065
I'm no longer me

2354
02:42:40,575 --> 02:42:43,091
Since the day we met

2355
02:42:50,819 --> 02:42:52,569
Come, sit in my car, babe

2356
02:42:53,110 --> 02:42:55,069
Come, sit in my car, babe

2357
02:42:55,506 --> 02:42:57,580
Come, sit in my car, babe

2358
02:42:57,953 --> 02:43:00,057
Come, sit in my car, babe

2359
02:43:00,346 --> 02:43:03,735
Long drive, full speed,
stopping nowhere

2360
02:43:04,819 --> 02:43:05,777
Shut up!

2361
02:43:07,391 --> 02:43:09,777
Can't you see she is emotional?

2362
02:43:21,334 --> 02:43:22,027
Hi.

2363
02:43:23,026 --> 02:43:25,485
I am dyed in your colours now.
Everything is Rani Pink.

2364
02:43:26,895 --> 02:43:28,110
I'm sorry.

2365
02:43:31,209 --> 02:43:33,902
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm really sorry.

2366
02:43:35,444 --> 02:43:37,027
In love, no sorry, no thank you!

2367
02:43:38,277 --> 02:43:39,819
This is Rocky and Rani's love story.

2368
02:43:39,944 --> 02:43:42,027
Can't be brushed off
like dandruff!

2369
02:43:45,902 --> 02:43:49,027
- You really are unique!
- Whatever I am, I'm yours.

2370
02:43:52,610 --> 02:43:54,821
- I love you!
- I love you from last life.

2371
02:44:01,985 --> 02:44:04,319
Will you kiss me?
Or do I hit you?

2372
02:44:04,694 --> 02:44:05,569
One second.

2373
02:44:05,819 --> 02:44:07,819
Give us happy vibes!

2374
02:44:11,328 --> 02:44:13,941
Paths going nowhere

2375
02:44:14,061 --> 02:44:16,554
Now lead somewhere

2376
02:44:16,674 --> 02:44:19,304
You make all troubles disappear

2377
02:44:19,424 --> 02:44:21,877
You can be trouble too

2378
02:44:21,997 --> 02:44:24,287
Since the day we met

2379
02:44:24,683 --> 02:44:26,909
Since the day we met

2380
02:44:27,368 --> 02:44:29,803
I'm no longer me

2381
02:44:30,067 --> 02:44:32,249
Since the day we met

2382
02:44:32,645 --> 02:44:37,518
My heart came to flower

2383
02:44:37,990 --> 02:44:40,606
With the coming of spring

2384
02:44:40,726 --> 02:44:43,316
Since the day we met

2385
02:44:51,587 --> 02:44:56,569
At this age, my pride and self-respect
won't allow me to think

2386
02:44:56,694 --> 02:44:59,569
that perhaps I was wrong.

2387
02:45:00,297 --> 02:45:03,319
So I give you this peace offering:

2388
02:45:03,902 --> 02:45:06,277
the secret laddoo recipe

2389
02:45:07,944 --> 02:45:10,235
that my grandmother gave me.

2390
02:45:11,152 --> 02:45:16,610
I trust you will not make
the same mistakes that I have made.

2391
02:45:19,360 --> 02:45:21,360
Congratulations on your wedding, dear.

2392
02:45:22,277 --> 02:45:23,819
A long life to you.

2393
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:46,819
There's the girl with stars
in her eyes

2394
02:45:47,874 --> 02:45:52,402
Here she comes, the lovely bride,
bringing spring with her

2395
02:45:53,277 --> 02:45:57,569
The wedding music plays,
tears well in every eye

2396
02:45:58,838 --> 02:46:03,027
There's the girl with stars
in her eyes

2397
02:46:04,194 --> 02:46:07,944
Here she comes, the lovely bride,
bringing spring with her

2398
02:46:09,633 --> 02:46:13,152
The wedding music plays,
tears well in every eye

2399
02:46:15,106 --> 02:46:18,913
The wedding music plays,
tears well in every eye

2400
02:46:29,059 --> 02:46:31,735
Childhood passes so quickly

2401
02:46:34,435 --> 02:46:37,152
Like the months of spring

2402
02:46:39,027 --> 02:46:42,485
Now your new life begins

2403
02:46:43,486 --> 02:46:47,985
In your dear husband's home

2404
02:46:50,819 --> 02:46:53,985
Feels like home to you

2405
02:46:55,383 --> 02:46:58,902
Now your new life begins

2406
02:47:00,726 --> 02:47:04,360
May the evil eye never fall on you

2407
02:47:06,143 --> 02:47:09,819
Your parents' home is full

2408
02:47:12,652 --> 02:47:15,527
Adorned with marigolds

2409
02:47:18,104 --> 02:47:20,694
Your palanquin is ready

2410
02:47:23,527 --> 02:47:26,277
Those days of your childhood

2411
02:47:27,819 --> 02:47:31,735
No one can stop them pass by

2412
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:36,819
Now your new life begins

2413
02:47:38,827 --> 02:47:42,027
Now your new life begins

2414
02:47:45,360 --> 02:47:49,194
There's the girl with stars
in her eyes

2415
02:47:50,621 --> 02:47:55,402
Here she comes, the lovely bride,
bringing spring with her

2416
02:47:56,198 --> 02:48:00,569
The wedding music plays,
tears well in every eye

2417
02:48:01,412 --> 02:48:05,708
The wedding music plays,
tears well in every eye

2418
02:48:07,035 --> 02:48:11,610
When you bid farewell
to your parents

2419
02:48:12,552 --> 02:48:16,610
You will take their joy with you

2420
02:48:17,971 --> 02:48:22,277
Who does the birdsong awaken
at dawn?

2421
02:48:23,283 --> 02:48:27,694
Who has the sun come to meet
in the courtyard?

2422
02:48:29,017 --> 02:48:31,819
The feelings we kept silent
in our hearts

2423
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:37,027
Are spoken today for all to hear

2424
02:48:38,610 --> 02:48:42,485
Tell your brother all about it

2425
02:48:44,107 --> 02:48:47,985
Just how much I really love you

2426
02:48:50,819 --> 02:48:53,607
Wedding bangles on your wrists

2427
02:48:55,069 --> 02:48:59,027
Your childhood toys all gone

2428
02:49:00,865 --> 02:49:04,152
Now your new life begins

2429
02:49:07,194 --> 02:49:09,694
Childhood passes so quickly

2430
02:49:12,636 --> 02:49:15,235
Like the months of spring

2431
02:49:17,227 --> 02:49:20,610
Now your new life begins

2432
02:49:22,584 --> 02:49:25,576
Now your new life begins

2433
02:49:28,097 --> 02:49:31,203
Now your new life begins

2434
02:49:33,417 --> 02:49:37,105
Now your new life begins

2435
02:49:39,560 --> 02:49:44,113
There's the girl with stars
in her eyes

2436
02:49:45,145 --> 02:49:49,102
Here she comes, the lovely bride,
bringing spring with her

2437
02:49:50,721 --> 02:49:54,518
The wedding music plays,
tears well in every eye

2438
02:49:56,106 --> 02:50:00,929
The wedding music plays,
tears well in every eye

2439
02:50:34,235 --> 02:50:37,934
Colourless were the days

2440
02:50:39,867 --> 02:50:43,238
Colourless were the nights

2441
02:50:45,542 --> 02:50:49,042
To my world

2442
02:50:50,206 --> 02:50:53,162
You brought colour

2443
02:50:56,676 --> 02:51:00,043
Bland were the moments

2444
02:51:02,187 --> 02:51:05,248
Lived till today

2445
02:51:07,738 --> 02:51:10,749
To my world

2446
02:51:12,427 --> 02:51:15,417
You brought life

2447
02:51:18,700 --> 02:51:21,278
Paths going nowhere

2448
02:51:21,510 --> 02:51:24,018
Now lead somewhere

2449
02:51:24,255 --> 02:51:26,945
You make all troubles disappear

2450
02:51:27,065 --> 02:51:29,675
You can be trouble too

2451
02:51:29,997 --> 02:51:34,665
Since the day we met

2452
02:51:35,573 --> 02:51:37,963
I'm no longer me

2453
02:51:38,373 --> 02:51:40,626
Since the day we met

2454
02:51:40,959 --> 02:51:44,647
My heart came to flower

2455
02:51:46,712 --> 02:51:49,290
With the coming of spring

2456
02:51:49,537 --> 02:51:54,298
Since the day we met

2457
02:51:57,896 --> 02:52:02,128
Since the day we met

2458
02:52:25,635 --> 02:52:30,022
The pages of our life were blank

2459
02:52:31,222 --> 02:52:35,060
Without love in our lives

2460
02:52:36,816 --> 02:52:41,460
Heartaches run through lines
of verse

2461
02:52:42,281 --> 02:52:45,971
For those with love stories

2462
02:52:48,069 --> 02:52:51,187
There was a time in the eyes
of the world

2463
02:52:51,307 --> 02:52:53,238
We had no name

2464
02:52:53,730 --> 02:52:58,055
Now they call us the
eternal lovers

2465
02:52:59,357 --> 02:53:03,702
Since the day we met

2466
02:53:04,818 --> 02:53:07,597
I'm no longer me

2467
02:53:07,802 --> 02:53:09,896
Since the day we met

2468
02:53:10,467 --> 02:53:14,172
My heart came to flower

2469
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:18,663
With the coming of spring

2470
02:53:18,946 --> 02:53:23,294
Since the day we met

2471
02:53:27,132 --> 02:53:31,821
Since the day we met

2472
02:53:52,395 --> 02:53:56,416
Since the day we met

2473
02:54:23,617 --> 02:54:28,268
O crazy one!

2474
02:54:29,183 --> 02:54:33,218
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

2475
02:54:34,655 --> 02:54:39,575
O crazy one!

2476
02:54:40,216 --> 02:54:43,738
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

2477
02:54:46,117 --> 02:54:49,545
How deep is your love for her?

2478
02:54:51,480 --> 02:54:54,510
Have you ever asked yourself?

2479
02:54:57,003 --> 02:55:01,239
When selfishness has no hold
over you

2480
02:55:02,474 --> 02:55:05,438
Only then can you truly love

2481
02:55:07,438 --> 02:55:09,542
Heed my words

2482
02:55:10,113 --> 02:55:12,296
Heed my words

2483
02:55:12,866 --> 02:55:16,773
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

2484
02:55:18,276 --> 02:55:22,332
O crazy one!

2485
02:55:23,775 --> 02:55:27,787
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

2486
02:55:29,679 --> 02:55:34,112
In exchange of her smile
grant me a thousand tears

2487
02:55:35,168 --> 02:55:38,889
O crazy one!

2488
02:55:40,578 --> 02:55:45,345
True love demands this condition.
Why question it?

2489
02:55:46,054 --> 02:55:49,611
O crazy one!

2490
02:55:53,793 --> 02:55:58,288
Forget stubbornness.
Forget conditions

2491
02:55:59,206 --> 02:56:03,125
All is endured in love

2492
02:56:04,578 --> 02:56:08,859
That's the heartless learn to love

2493
02:56:10,088 --> 02:56:13,879
A little distance is not a bad thing

2494
02:56:15,610 --> 02:56:18,750
Love s fragrance spreads from away

2495
02:56:20,966 --> 02:56:24,969
Without you, my story is incomplete

2496
02:56:26,938 --> 02:56:30,844
Who says lovers are united forever

2497
02:56:32,383 --> 02:56:35,328
Where is this written?

2498
02:56:37,917 --> 02:56:41,262
When our worlds become one

2499
02:56:43,406 --> 02:56:46,416
Then your love will be complete

2500
02:56:48,333 --> 02:56:51,556
Come into his arms

2501
02:56:53,861 --> 02:56:57,361
O crazy one! O naïve heart of mine

2502
02:56:59,243 --> 02:57:03,168
O crazy one!

2503
02:57:04,646 --> 02:57:08,666
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

2504
02:57:32,104 --> 02:57:37,388
We always pray for what
we do not have

2505
02:57:37,648 --> 02:57:42,050
This is your fault

2506
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:48,018
Why behave indifferently towards
those you love?

2507
02:57:48,311 --> 02:57:53,266
Why do such a thing? Tell me.

2508
02:57:53,976 --> 02:57:59,148
Your disregard worries me

2509
02:58:00,064 --> 02:58:04,570
You're either a character in your own life
or someone else's

2510
02:58:04,690 --> 02:58:06,950
Now you choose

2511
02:58:07,404 --> 02:58:09,569
Now you choose

2512
02:58:10,111 --> 02:58:14,124
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

2513
02:58:15,500 --> 02:58:20,118
O crazy one!

2514
02:58:21,034 --> 02:58:25,143
O crazy one!
O naïve heart of mine

2515
02:58:26,977 --> 02:58:31,803
In exchange of her smile
grant me a thousand tears

2516
02:58:32,338 --> 02:58:36,031
O crazy one!

2517
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:43,210
True love demands this condition.
Why question it?

2518
02:58:43,330 --> 02:58:47,042
O crazy one!
