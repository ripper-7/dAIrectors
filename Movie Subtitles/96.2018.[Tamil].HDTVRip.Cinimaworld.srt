"I love the sea."

00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:02,792
"After the hair greys"

00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:07,992
"I understand the world."

"Yesterday's joys come together"

6
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:20,632
"Today, at this moment,"
they find meaning."

7
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:26,432
"Today's joys will come together"

meaning tomorrow."

that I never lived."

00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:42,752
"Unable to bear this, upwards I go"

11
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:48,432
"To kindle my never ending passion."

12
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:53,792
"Here and now, I am coming out of it"

13
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:58,992
"Here and now,
I immerse into the depths"

14
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:25,312
"I look at myself
as someone else."

15
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:28,872
"Not with any reason,
just naturally."

16
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,992
"With clarity, like
that of a sunray!"

17
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:36,792
"I dont belong to these depths,
but I dwell in them."

18
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:39,392
"As a mirror I am born"

19
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:42,592
"I become everything I see."

20
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:45,632
"The joy of a kitten's
caress on my feet"

21
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,032
"Is a life enough for me."

22
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:53,472
"I want to stroke, everything I
come across, beautifully!"

23
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:56,192
"I will always be myself."

24
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:59,072
"Every day I will
live to the fullest"

25
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:04,992
"Will object, a life
of conventions."

26
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:10,632
"I will live a life
of supreme essence!!!"

27
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:16,512
"I will become as
pure as possible."

28
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:42,232
"With the wind flies the Hawk."

29
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:45,672
"Beautifully, without a path."

30
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:48,832
"It being its own reality."

31
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:53,552
"Like the rock that goes to
the depth of the waters"

32
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:56,352
"With a renouncing of sound"

33
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:59,192
"I drown in the sights I see."

34
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,312
"Like the bird that rides
on the bull's hump"

35
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,752
"I will live upon the Earth."

36
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:10,192
"I would join hands,
and walk along with the Earth."

37
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:13,192
"Some kind of ecstasy is flowing"

38
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:15,792
"That provides depth!!!"

39
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:18,392
"This moment envelops like a mother"

40
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,792

00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:05,592
"Today, at this moment
they find meaning."

"Today's joys will
come together"

48
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:16,112
"To find their meaning tomorrow."

49
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:26,992
(Priest's chants)

50
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:47,992
Come.

51
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:50,112
Come, all of you.

52
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,192
Good morning

53
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:58,392
Greetings.

54
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:00,272
Greetings sir.

55
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:01,752
What's the time?

56
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:03,352
8:59 am.

57
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:06,152
9 to 6, in 36 frames, we are going to
click photographs in your digital camera.

58
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,232
No preview.
No deleting, if you find a mistake.

59
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:10,992
We need to know
what's your mistake.

60
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,872
9 to 6, no one should to talk to each
other, no chatting, no whatsapping.

61
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:14,832
Okay, sir

62
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:17,032
Every frame that you capture
should be one that you admired...

63
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:18,872
and not what you took
to impress others.

64
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:31,232
- Hey ! call out!
- Focus!

65
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,392
I got it sir, I got it.

66
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:41,752
Sir...

67
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:45,592
Good

68
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:17,352
Only photography, possess
the quality to freeze time.

69
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,032
Prabha, in that photo of
mine which you clicked...

70
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:22,512
whenever I see it,
I will be 37 only.

71
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,272
So make it count

72
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:25,512
Leave the moment

73
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:27,232
Sir, one selfie with you

74
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,512
A selfie with me itself is it?

75
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:30,952
Hey! Don't overlap.

76
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:34,272
Does anyone know how to drive?
I have not had enough sleep.

77
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,592
 Sir, I know

78
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:37,232
I can drive.

79
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:38,952
Are you sure?

80
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:40,352
Okay be ready tomorrow morning.

81
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:41,632
Okay, sir

82
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:56,752
Hey!

83
00:09:57,032 --> 00:09:58,192
I will wake up in the
middle and check

84
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:00,472
If you cross 100km, you had it!

85
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,992
- Okay, sir.
- Got it?

86
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:03,992
Listen! If you feel sleepy, do tell.

87
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,752
Don't just go bang it. Okay!

88
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:31,432
Thanks

89
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:01,032
Thanjavur sir.

90
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,152
You were fast asleep sir.

91
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:07,512
That's why I did
not wake you up.

92
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,872
Some problem in Kollidam bridge.

93
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,672
That's why we have to go through
Thanjavur and then Trichy.

94
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,752
Google maps are on.

95
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:19,912
Go straight.

96
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:22,112
Google says left.

97
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:23,272
Don't listen to that.
Listen to me.

98
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:24,592
Go straight.

99
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:25,912
Okay, sir

100
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:27,712
Roll the window down.

101
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,192
Now just smell the air outside.

102
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,712
So, how is it,
the air of my native?

103
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:35,992
This is your native sir?

104
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,632
This is where I was
born and brought up.

105
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:39,272
My native!

106
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:41,952
See that's the old bus stand.

107
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:45,312
After my parents got married, this is
where, they first came and got down.

108
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,192
Look there.
That's the government hospital.

109
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:48,512
That's where I was born.

110
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,992
Look there, can you see that?
That's Oriental towers.

111
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:52,832
The first shopping
complex in our town.

112
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,872
Here on the right side.
Raju's bakery.

113
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:56,872
Even after you have eaten well,
your mouth will water

114
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,472
Egg puff!!!

115
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,752
Can you see a hospital there?

116
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:03,592
Next to that, was
where my house used to be.

117
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:05,152
I myself, am not able
to recognize the place.

118
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:05,992
Should I stop here, sir?

119
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:08,752
No...no, If someone sees me,
I will have to talk.

120
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,672
Do you know what that is?

121
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:14,112
- The Big Temple.
- Yes, who built it?

122
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,832
Raja Raja Cholan.

123
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:17,992
Hey, that...

124
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,432
What happened sir?

125
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:51,032
Can you go in full speed, and stop
in front of him and scare him?

126
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:55,072
Can you go in full speed, and stop
in front of him and scare him?

127
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:55,912
Now watch.

128
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:56,792
Go

129
00:12:56,912 --> 00:13:00,032
Go...go

130
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,232
Go...go

131
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:10,512
Enough...enough.

132
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:17,472
Good morning, officer

133
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:19,592
K.Ramachandran.

134
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:22,992
Hey! Little one!!!
It's you is it!

135
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,712
No wonder!

136
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:29,672
I was thinking, who has so much guts
to come and run the car over me.

137
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,512
Are you fine?

138
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:33,312
What is this,
you started off well no

139
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:34,672
Why you suddenly
giving me respect?

140
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:37,032
You better go back to
calling me like old times!

141
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,232
You still haven't stopped charming
people with your laughter!

142
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:41,792
Come let's go drink tea.

143
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,592
How come your here?

144
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:47,472
Because...

145
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,952
I am going on asking you,
and your looking elsewhere.

146
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,592
Uncle! Shall I just go and
take a look around school?

147
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:57,592
Oh! no! that's very difficult!

148
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:58,712
That's not possible.

149
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:01,512
First you have to get the
principal's permission.

150
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:04,672
Then you have to get the
signature of your parents.

151
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,432
Are you serious?

152
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,672
Hey! What is this unusual question?

153
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:11,032
This is your school.
Go and see it.

154
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,152
K.Ramachandran.

155
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,712
That's me!

156
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:27,392
When did you come?

157
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:28,712
Just now.

158
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,832
Just take that stone little one.

159
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:49,312
I just, got carried away
by the old memories.

160
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:55,992
I took out,
without breaking it.

161
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:58,792
Thank you

162
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:03,752
You remember,
your friend, who stuck to you.

163
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:05,792
From philomina nagar

164
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:09,232
- Are you still in touch with him?
- No

165
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:11,112
Because of work

166
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,672
There's just no time.

167
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:16,152
This is a photograph
of the school , is it?

168
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:22,592
Hello!

169
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:25,432
I am All Saint's School,
watchman speaking.

170
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:27,592
Oh! Protector!
How are you?

171
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:28,392
Murali here

172
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:31,712
Murali, how are you?
I am your protector only speaking!

173
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:32,432
I am fine

174
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,312
We were just talking about you.

175
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:36,472
Ram just dialed your
number.

176
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:37,192
What about you?

177
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:39,512
Am fine darling.
How are you?

178
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:04,475
Everything will happen only
according to one's fate .

179
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,355
Just concentrate on your work.

180
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:09,795
Little one, Murali wants
to talk to you.

181
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:12,915
Hey! Savage!

182
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,475
What are you doing there?

183
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:16,155
Actually, I don't know.

184
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:18,155
What sort of answer is this.

185
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:19,075
How's school?

186
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:19,595
Dude...!

187
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,195
Is it still the same or
have they rebuilt it?

188
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:22,635
Dude! It's just like before.

189
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:26,915
Same building, same table,
same chair, same protector!

190
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,035
Hey! Let's do a video call!

191
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,635
What rubbish!
what's keeping you so busy?

192
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:32,275
Come here and see it.

193
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,515
Hey! call please!

194
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:36,475
Dude! This is a feeling.
Come and see it live!

195
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:38,275
Isn't it around 10 to 15
years since we passed out?

196
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:39,635
- Excuse me!
- School is exactly the

197
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,195
 What you saying 10 to 15 years?

198
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,795
Fat hopes, one whack,
I will give you.

199
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,595
You and me completed
school in'96

200
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:46,195
Now it's 2016.

201
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:48,475
Do you know subtraction,
or should I do it?

202
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,915
Hey! Twenty years,
has gone by is it?

203
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:51,955
Holy smokes!

204
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,075
Didn't even realize it.

205
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:54,635
Yes, dude! We have grown older.

206
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:55,715
Now why you reminding me about that.

207
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,355
At least who have seen
a lot of places

208
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,515
I haven't stepped
outside Tamil Nadu.

209
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:02,115
Okay, let that be, we have a
lot left to experience, dude!

210
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:04,235
I will prepare the list,
when are you coming to Chennai?

211
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:05,995
Okay listen to me carefully.

212
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:08,035
I am coming from Thanjavur.

213
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:10,035
After I reach, I will
come and see you.

214
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:13,075
I have to write it in water,
your empty promises.

215
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:15,755
Okay, what's with the
sudden visit to Thanjavur?

216
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,195
I will come and tell
you about that.

217
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,995
Do you have any of
our friends numbers?

218
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:20,315
I want to call and talk to them.

219
00:21:20,355 --> 00:21:21,955
Hey! Crazy brother!

220
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:25,395
It will take ages, to get
everyone's numbers and talk to them

221
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:26,355
Then?

222
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:33,155
Why you worried, we have the
useless, school whatsapp group!

223
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:34,795
Who do you think is
the admin for that?

224
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,595
Who else! It's you dude.

225
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:38,555
Even in school you were the one.

226
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:39,635
Now, no one can beat you to it.

227
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:42,755
- Hey! say that when you among people.
- Okay dude.

228
00:21:42,795 --> 00:21:44,195
Now I will add you to the group.

229
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:45,675
Thanks, dude.

230
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:54,075
Welcome back to school
Mr. K.Ramachandran.

231
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,635
May I come in, please?

232
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:01,515
Hi, you late comer.

233
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:02,875
Hi, friends

234
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:04,115
Dude!!!

235
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:04,955
Hi, Ram

236
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:06,395
Hello! Photographer

237
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:08,355
The Lion has entered the arena!

238
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:10,155
Oh! look who has joined!

239
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,515
Hey Savage, where were
you all these days?

240
00:22:12,795 --> 00:22:15,475
No matter what, a hero is
a hero, a comedian is a comedian!

241
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:18,235
No one bothered
when I was added to the group.

242
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,075
You're not on any social network

243
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:22,035
How come you came onto the group?

244
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:25,355
I had gone to our
school this morning

245
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:29,115
After I saw our classroom and our playground
I just felt like talking to all of you.

246
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:31,675
Now I feel like
seeing all of you.

247
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:37,115
Hey! Ram! Even feel
like seeing you.

248
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,435
The groom himself has spoken.
We are definitely meeting.

249
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,475
As a Ram say
we all should meet our sometimes

250
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:43,515
Hey! now you want to see all of us

251
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:44,475
Is it not?

252
00:22:44,555 --> 00:22:45,835
Here, take a look !

253
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,395
Hey Ram

254
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:03,715
Post a current photo of yours

255
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,155
Let's see how you look.

256
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:12,315
Hey! handsome!

257
00:23:12,355 --> 00:23:13,955
Cannot recognize you at all.

258
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:15,395
As though we are all
growing younger

259
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,915
That's why he wants
to see everyone.

260
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:18,395
Admin is typing

261
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:20,275
Then definitely there will
be some important message.

262
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,635
I'm waiting

263
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:23,515
We are the'96'batch

264
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:25,235
It's been 20 years
since we passed out

265
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:28,035
I feel it would be great
if we have a reunion.

266
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,835
Everyone will get an opportunity
to see each other as well.

267
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:30,555
Super idea

268
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:31,475
I vote

269
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:33,035
Awesome dude!

270
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:34,715
After all I am the class leader!!!

271
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:36,155
Superb idea!

272
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,515
Oh! now I have to say something!

273
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:38,555
Hey Murali!

274
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:40,915
You're too cool!

275
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:41,755
Hey!

276
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,115
Since all of us are online,
let's fix the place also now!

277
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:46,555
Thanjavur?

278
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,155
Then why not at Thiruvarur

279
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:48,795
Nonsense

280
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:50,555
Are we conducting
a classical music concert!

281
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,435
Look, just a few of you are in Thanjavur

282
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:54,035
Most of us are in Chennai

283
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:57,395
The rest have ran away
to US, UK, Australia

284
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:59,075
Then is Chennai, fine?

285
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:01,955
Super

286
00:24:01,995 --> 00:24:03,475
Chennai is fine.

287
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:05,315
That will be easy for everyone.

288
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:06,835
Then, when?

289
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,115
That's what matters

290
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,315
Carefully plan that.

291
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,675
Half the people will promise
to come, later on ditch us.

292
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,675
Definitely keep it
during a weekend.

293
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:16,075
We can also try during the holidays.

294
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:17,235
What's the date today?

295
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:17,915
Jan 7th.

296
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:20,315
Two months from today
is our reunion!!!

297
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:22,835
That would be March 7th!
In Chennai!

298
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:24,795
All of you better be there.

299
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:26,355
Double okay

300
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:27,595
Those who don't come
will die puking blood

301
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:28,595
You rocked it dude!

302
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,395
Ram we should thank
you for this!

303
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:32,955
Long live K. Ramachandran.

304
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:34,875
So, cool, everything
got fixed so fast!

305
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:36,155
Hey! someone tell my wife.

306
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:37,235
If I ask, she won't let me come.

307
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:38,675
Can we bring the kids?

308
00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:39,995
It would be very difficult
to leave them and come.

309
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,115
Please come us family

310
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:44,955
This is the first time you guys have done
something meaningful after starting the group

311
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:54,195
'Two months later'

312
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:02,795
I don't think
I can make it

313
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:04,875
I really miss you

314
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:07,435
Hi, what's app dude
how are you doing?

315
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,435
Hello my friends,

316
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:10,515
I know you will be annoyed
if I speak in English like this.

317
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:11,955
That's Vinoth.

318
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:14,955
Hi!

319
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:17,595
- Hi!
- Hi!

320
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:18,435
How are you?

321
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,075
- It's been a long time.
- I'm fine.

322
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:20,755
How are you?

323
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:21,555
Idiot.

324
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:23,315
I told you, take the left at the
temple and then the second right,...

325
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,915
you have done the opposite.

326
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:26,915
Hey! I don't know all that

327
00:25:26,955 --> 00:25:29,155
Come back to the temple,
I can only direct from there.

328
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,675
 Hang up! hang up!

329
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:35,035
Dude!!!!!

330
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:36,755
Are you fine?

331
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:39,115
Come! Come!

332
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:41,475
Hey! why hasn't he come yet?

333
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,875
Trusting he would come,
I have ordered extra food.

334
00:25:43,955 --> 00:25:45,715
 I had called him thrice.

335
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:50,035
The third time I called him, he
said he will come and hit me...

336
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,355
if I call him again and hung up.

337
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:53,155
In spite of that I
called him again

338
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:55,715
Wonder what he is going
to come and do to me.

339
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,195
Hey is this Gulab Jamun?

340
00:25:58,235 --> 00:25:59,995
No, red bricks,
you want to eat?

341
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:07,875
He has posted a poetry
about that girl on Facebook!

342
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:09,795
- Is that so?
- What had he posted?

343
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,155
Geetha

344
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:13,955
Tell me...tell me

345
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:16,875
Tell me...tell me

346
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:18,035
Hey! hold his hand.

347
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:21,955
Geetha, give me the key to
open the door to your heart?

348
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:49,035
Hey!

349
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:52,155
Dude!!!

350
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,435
Wait...wait

351
00:26:57,755 --> 00:27:00,715
Hey carry him!

352
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,235
Hey! leave me
I've grown old!

353
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:12,435
"If my friend asks for my life,
I will say take it!!"

354
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:14,915
Hey! with whose
permission did you kiss me?

355
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:15,995
Okay

356
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:19,195
Now go meet your darling sister,
before she gets wild.

357
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:21,795
I can sense someone boiling

358
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:23,275
Yeah right

359
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:25,275
You promised to come and see
me the next day itself!

360
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:27,155
My dear niece, your uncle has come!

361
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:27,955
Niece?

362
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:29,715
What if this one's also a boy?
Won't you accept it?

363
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:31,555
No way! I want a girl.

364
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:33,595
I have named her Iniyaval.
It's a done deal.

365
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:34,515
Okay, my darling!

366
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:35,755
Even she agrees!

367
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:38,355
Okay it's going to be a girl.
Now you eat the sweet.

368
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:41,595
Hi Sathish, how are you?

369
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,475
Now come and talk properly

370
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,275
After you are married and have kids.

371
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:49,115
When I used to come then and talk,
all of you, would ignore me.

372
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,515
Sir, you don't worry
she is very good girl

373
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:54,835
She's a very helpful girl.

374
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,395
During exams, she used to
help us copy.

375
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:58,475
Is it not guys?

376
00:27:58,515 --> 00:27:59,715
Yes! Yes!

377
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:16,835
- Do you know where Saravanan is now?
- Where?

378
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,315
What kind of photographs are these?

379
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:20,115
Can hardly see the faces,
in the dim light.

380
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:20,955
Horrible!

381
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:22,995
And you call yourself a photographer!

382
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,675
Hey! has everyone come?

383
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:25,515
We have to order food.

384
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:26,635
Four of them are yet to come.

385
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:29,395
Three of them
have been given directions.

386
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:31,355
Then, what about the fourth?

387
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:34,635
Huh?

388
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:36,275
Who is the fourth?

389
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,035
Why you blinking?

390
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:40,635
Huh!

391
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:43,835
Hello!

392
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:46,995
Huh!

393
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:51,755
Come on say it!

394
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:54,155
Why is he acting so weird?

395
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,195
Janu!

396
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:43,595
"The fragrance of a flower
is that a melody?"

397
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:51,275
"What blossoms in a young woman's heart
is that a rhythm?"

398
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:58,955
"Heart's desires are like
the varieties in flowers."

399
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:03,035
"A bird's song and it's vibes"

400
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:07,195
"Is the dawn's welcome."

401
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,955
'For us Janu always meant singing,'

402
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,395
'But for her, singing was everything!'

403
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:26,315
'She used to either sing
or talk about that song.'

404
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:28,635
'Like the pitch, rhythm, tempo, etc'

405
00:30:28,715 --> 00:30:30,955
'We never understood anything.'

406
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,075
Hey! wait even I am coming.

407
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:33,755
'Apparently, when Janu was in
her mother's womb itself'

408
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:35,795
'They had decided to name the
baby, after famous singers,'

409
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:39,835
'SP. Balasubramaniam if a
boy and S.Janaki if a girl.'

410
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,555
'Such was their family's affinity
towards music.'

411
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:44,555
'Wonder, what it was about that day,
they named her Janaki Devi'

412
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,115
'She never sang any other
songs, other than that of S.Janaki.'

413
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:48,075
'Except one!!!'

414
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,475
In all directions,

415
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:55,595
echoed the tamilian pride!!!

416
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:58,115
Hail!!! The Tamilian!!!

417
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:00,435
'Sometimes while listening
to certain songs on the radio'

418
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:03,515
'It sounded like Janu's
songs being sung.'

419
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:06,715
'Her voice her face is what,
used to come to my mind.'

420
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:09,115
'So it wasn't just her singing'

421
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,035
'I was fond of Janu, herself!'

422
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,795
'Even she knew that.'

423
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:18,075
'That was the only reason why
my attendance was a 90%'

424
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:19,675
'She was the reason.'

425
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:24,475
'We have literally been studying
together from our kindergarten days.'

426
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:27,435
'From then till today, I always
listen to whatever she says!'

427
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,555
'Even she used to ask only me,
if she wanted anything.'

428
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,835
'There were days I used
to be sad,...'

429
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,835
'mulling over my poor marks
and other things.'

430
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,915
'No one else would have noticed,
but Janu would come to me,'

431
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,595
'and just ask, what happened?'

432
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:52,915
'That was enough!'

433
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,915
'That one word had
the power of ten elephants.'

434
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:57,955
'It set my heartbeat racing!!!'

435
00:31:57,995 --> 00:32:01,875
'Spirited enough to go bash up
a bunch of harmless guys.'

436
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:08,475
'I really can't explain
what Janu meant to me'

437
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:11,035
'The only thing I would pray for,
when I go to the temple is'

438
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:12,115
'God!'

439
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:15,675
'Always keep Janu
within my eyesight!'

Cell means small

I am asking you only.

Janu has not come.

00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:04,395
(Indistinct chatter)

490
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:18,635
Your brother is calling you.

491
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:22,635
What?

492
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:25,155
Where is Janu?

493
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,195
I don't know.

494
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:28,755
I will kick you.

495
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:33,995
Kick me? You think my hands
will be plucking flowers is it?

496
00:34:35,395 --> 00:34:38,355
You're the one who is always
with her, don't you know?!

497
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:41,035
I don't know.
How will only I know?!

498
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:45,995
Even I am always
with you, is it not?

499
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:48,075
I don't even know
where her house is.

500
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:51,715
Okay, you pay attention to the class.

501
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:53,675
If she catches us,
she will yell!

502
00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:05,435
OH! MY! GOD!

503
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:28,955
He knows where Janu's house is.

504
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:31,315
It is somewhere close by,
near Kaveri super market.

505
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,795
It seems there will be a name
board 'Sukumar', outside her house.

506
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,275
Somewhere here only

507
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:22,835
Brother! Shall we leave now?

508
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,235
It's getting dark

509
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:28,195
If we get later than this,
mom will kill me.

510
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,195
Anyway she will definitely
come to school on Monday.

511
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:47,875
What happened?

512
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:48,355
Hmm

513
00:36:48,395 --> 00:36:49,515
Why so late?

514
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:51,075
Special class.

515
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:55,395
"Oh! Darling"

516
00:36:55,435 --> 00:37:00,235
"I will never let you go!"

517
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:06,955
"Whatever happens I won't
let my shyness go."

518
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:10,995
"It can rain nonstop."

519
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:14,555
'SATURDAY'

520
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,755
'SUNDAY'

521
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,315
I told you
It was enough.

522
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:00,835
'MONDAY'

523
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:24,795
Hey!!!

524
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,955
Go inside
You rascal!

525
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:11,555
Hey! Janu has come.

526
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:18,915
'I was seeing Janu after 4 to 5 days
and she was sick too.'

527
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:21,835
'If I was the same person
as I used to be'

528
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,515
'I would have run up to her and would
have enquired about her health.'

529
00:39:24,555 --> 00:39:25,515
What happened Janu?

530
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:27,835
'That day I just couldn't move'

531
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:29,595
'Something stopped me!'

532
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:30,875
Now you alright?

533
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,515
'Everyone was enquiring about
her health, except me.'

534
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:35,235
All of you go your place

535
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:38,315
'I wanted to run towards her,
hold her hand and ask,'

536
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,115
'why did you not come
all these days,'

537
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:43,235
'and how I suffered in your absence.'

538
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:44,515
'But I somehow couldn't.'

539
00:39:44,555 --> 00:39:45,875
You are having high fever.

540
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:46,875
Why did you come to school?

541
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,115
'Miss, I am better now.'

542
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,235
You should have taken rest at home.

543
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:51,835
- Subha take care of her.
- Yes Miss

544
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,755
All of you take you class work

545
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,715
'At that time I did not know how
to explain what that meant.'

546
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:20,795
'But as far I could understand,'

547
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,195
'that was the first love
of our class!!!'

548
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:28,955
'I could not figure out
what was happening within me.'

549
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:31,355
'But I was over flowing
with happiness inside me.'

550
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,635
'My heart was jumping with joy!!!'

551
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:03,153
'It made me twist my
invisible moustache.'

552
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:07,553
'After that I could never
converse normally with, Janu.'

553
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:10,633
'I felt shy and awkward.'

554
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:13,513
'The minute I saw her,
I began to hide.'

555
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:18,753
'I couldn't stop myself from
telling Subha about this.'

556
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:40,633
'Then onwards it was all about,
just eye contact.'

557
00:41:40,713 --> 00:41:43,273
'I thought no one would find out.'

558
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:45,873
'But somehow Sathish found out.'

559
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:03,433
 Hey ! from when is this going on?

560
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:05,153
'If Sathish has come to know
Murali will also get to know it.'

561
00:42:05,193 --> 00:42:07,193
You guys have hidden it from me.

562
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:24,353
What?

563
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:29,393
With your thoughts elsewhere,
don't neglect your studies.

564
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:31,833
You should study well, okay?

565
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:35,753
Do you want to ask me anything?

566
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:40,993
Are you scared?

567
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:49,513
Okay, shall I leave now.

568
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:04,273
What happened?
Did he say something?

569
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:06,633
- Did you say something?
- No.

570
00:43:07,873 --> 00:43:10,233
Why are all of you
making so much of noise?

571
00:43:11,513 --> 00:43:12,953
Janu, you come here.

572
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:15,833
Ask her to sing
'By the banks of the river Yamuna'.

573
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:17,113
Janu.

574
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:21,153
He is requesting you to sing
'By the banks of the river Yamuna'.

575
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:35,753
"I am a small girl, I am a flower."

576
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:40,113
"I am a lotus,
I am a new honey bowl."

577
00:43:40,193 --> 00:43:44,233
"I am jaggery, I am a silver chariot."

578
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:47,753
"I am a calf,
I am the fresh rainy season."

579
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,153
Hey! I told her. She's
doing this on purpose.

580
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:52,953
He's asking you to sing
'By the banks of the river Yamuna'.

581
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:57,353
Sister, he has taken my geometry box and
wants you to sing some song.

582
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:59,553
I don't understand what is
so special about that song.

583
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,553
He's asking you so many times
to sing that song,

584
00:44:01,593 --> 00:44:03,473
what are you going to lose?

585
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:05,873
Janu, a fan request?

586
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:07,793
By the banks of the river Yamuna
from the film 'Thalapathy'.

587
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,193
Please sing, the song

588
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,793
Mr Messenger

589
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:13,673
Please go tell Mr Fan, that
even on 'All India Radio',

590
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:16,113
songs are played,
only when directly requested by the fan.

591
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,233
Okay!

592
00:44:19,793 --> 00:44:20,873
Murali!

593
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:23,473
Is it okay?

594
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:27,793
Now watch the fun!

595
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:34,833
"The eyes that spill
poetry, shut !"

596
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:38,633
"The feet sing a colourful song!"

597
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:42,473
"In Lord Kannan's chariot with desire!"

598
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:46,313
"Yearning drowns in blissful toddy!"

599
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:49,913
"In love"

600
00:44:53,873 --> 00:44:57,673
"Inside the love nest"

601
00:44:57,753 --> 00:45:00,833
"the love bird caresses!"

602
00:45:00,873 --> 00:45:03,513
'After that,
I tried so many different methods,'

603
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:06,113
'asking her,
but she never sang that song.'

604
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:07,793
'Stubborn donkey!'

605
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,393
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

606
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:11,753
Have some chocolates.

607
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:12,953
Did you go to the temple?

608
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:14,313
Yes, I went in the morning itself.

609
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:16,113
Where is your brother?

610
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:17,673
Wait! wait!

611
00:45:17,713 --> 00:45:19,313
Where did you buy your dress?
Maharaja stores?

612
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:21,113
No, from Kurunji stores.
Dad's choice.

613
00:45:21,193 --> 00:45:22,193
Okay

614
00:45:22,713 --> 00:45:23,553
Now turn.

615
00:45:27,353 --> 00:45:29,073
Have a chocolate.

616
00:45:40,313 --> 00:45:41,793
Take another one.

617
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,273
No, it's okay.

618
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:44,793
 You have grown like a buffalo

619
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,793
How will one be enough for you?

620
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:48,753
Take another one.

621
00:45:49,753 --> 00:45:52,593
Hey! don't let him go.
He will hit me!!!

622
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:58,113
Thank you.

623
00:45:58,193 --> 00:45:59,553
Thank you, is that it?

624
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,313
What is the occasion today?

625
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:05,273
Won't you wish me?

626
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:08,953
Happy...happy

627
00:46:08,993 --> 00:46:09,833
Happy what?

628
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:11,273
Happy Diwali is it?

629
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:17,873
Happy birthday

630
00:46:21,473 --> 00:46:22,713
Thanks

631
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:31,553
Why you sweating so much?
What did anyone do to you now?

632
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,193
Leave me.

633
00:46:36,633 --> 00:46:39,073
Hey! my brother's a sportsman,
that's why he's sweating.

634
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:40,273
Is it not?

635
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:45,353
What happened?

636
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:47,793
Hey! why is your heart
beating so fast?

637
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:50,753
What happened?

638
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:53,553
Just keep your hands
and check for yourself.

639
00:47:07,193 --> 00:47:08,313
Hey! brother!

640
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:09,793
Hold him! hold him!

641
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:11,793
You go get water.

642
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,113
Hey! get up!

643
00:47:13,473 --> 00:47:16,553
'Subha couldn't understand, why I was so
fascinated by Janu, that I fainted.'

644
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:18,153
Shame on you, to faint
in front of a girl.

645
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:20,033
Disgraceful!
Get up!

646
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:22,993
'Janu couldn't understand,
what she had done,'

647
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,433
'for someone, to be so
madly in love with her!!!'

648
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:27,953
'But, I K.Ramachandran
of the 10th standard,'

649
00:47:27,993 --> 00:47:30,433
'had no such confusion, even
in that exhausted state.'

650
00:47:30,753 --> 00:47:32,553
'Like a straight line
drawn with a scale,'

651
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:35,353
'my focus was only on Janu.'

652
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,753
'If I get married to Janu, you
know what her name will be?'

653
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:47,713
'Janaki. Ramachandran.'

654
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:49,033
Janu

655
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:54,793
'Everything was moving
along smoothly.'

656
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:24,873
- Miss...Please...don't do this.
- Come here.

657
00:48:24,913 --> 00:48:25,993
Please don't do this...

658
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,673
How dare you copy!

659
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:29,473
Sorry, Miss

660
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:44,873
Mr. Ramachandran, so our
holidays start from tomorrow.

661
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:48,593
I wonder, how you're going to
stay without seeing me for two months.

662
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:54,673
- Hey Janu ! come fast!
- What is this Subha...

663
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:56,393
Still addressing her by her name

664
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,273
You have all the rights to address her
as your sister-in-law!!!

665
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,993
Okay! I know what is what.
Now you come and take your cycle out.

666
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:06,153
Come fast.

667
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:49,233
Okay then, I will leave now.

668
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:09,513
Don't forget me.

669
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:27,833
Happy holidays

670
00:52:00,113 --> 00:52:02,313
How do you know she's coming?

671
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:05,033
I have been incessantly messaging and
calling her for the past one week.

672
00:52:05,073 --> 00:52:06,393
Not a single reply from her.

673
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:08,353
I got annoyed and
stopped calling her.

674
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:09,313
Then?

675
00:52:09,353 --> 00:52:12,073
Suddenly she texted this
morning, saying, she's coming.

676
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:13,833
- You didn't even tell me this
- Hey...

677
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:15,713
It's not like I did
not want to tell you

678
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:17,273
She's got to come all
the way from Singapore.

679
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:19,233
Thought I'd just wait
till she reaches here.

680
00:52:27,913 --> 00:52:29,073
Come here.

681
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:31,273
Look at him,
still behaving like a 10th standard kid.

682
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:33,353
Only thing missing is the school uniform.

683
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:37,193
Come here, or else I
will break your hand.

684
00:53:11,873 --> 00:53:13,873
Dude, like you're a saint.

685
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:16,673
Hey! Janu has come.

686
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:23,913
Hey Janu, how are you?

687
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:27,033
Here take this and share
it with everyone.

688
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:28,273
Yeah, say thank you

689
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:28,753
Thank you

690
00:53:28,793 --> 00:53:30,673
Hey! Subha has come, go see her.

691
00:53:35,153 --> 00:53:36,473
What dude?

692
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,313
 Sorry got a little delayed.

693
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,433
Thank God!
You at least came now.

694
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:42,033
This itself is a relief.
Come.

695
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:52,513
Finally I've come,
you happy now.

696
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:00,793
How are you?

697
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:01,633
I am fine.

698
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:02,873
- How are you?
- Come, sit.

699
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:04,233
I am fine.

700
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:05,473
How many months now?

701
00:54:05,513 --> 00:54:06,713
7 months.

702
00:54:06,753 --> 00:54:08,473
This is my second one.

703
00:54:10,073 --> 00:54:11,713
I never expected so
many of them to come.

704
00:54:11,753 --> 00:54:13,073
All your doing is it?

705
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:13,993
Everyone did their bit.

706
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:15,073
Don't even ask.

707
00:54:15,113 --> 00:54:16,393
Even I never expected.

708
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:19,153
I thought they would just nod in
agreement, and then ditch us.

709
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:21,233
Thank God, I had organized
some extra food.

710
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:22,673
Everyone has come.

711
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:25,033
He has had so many
ice creams from the time we came.

712
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:27,113
Hey! just ask him how many...

713
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,193
Go

714
00:54:38,073 --> 00:54:40,233
I never thought you would come.

715
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:50,953
Hey! buffalo!

716
00:54:50,993 --> 00:54:53,953
Hey! why you behaving like a kid?
Standing here with a balloon.

717
00:54:54,033 --> 00:54:55,033
Come.

718
00:54:55,153 --> 00:54:56,113
You go.

719
00:54:56,313 --> 00:54:57,513
You come.

720
00:54:57,593 --> 00:54:58,513
You go.

721
00:54:58,873 --> 00:55:00,593
Janu has come.
You come now.

722
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:03,553
You go.
Go.

723
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:05,793
- Hey! shut up and come.
- Hey! you go.

724
00:55:08,073 --> 00:55:10,233
Hey! I have grown older!

725
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,993
And you're hitting me like,
you used to in school.

726
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:13,753
Leave now or...just leave.

727
00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:15,033
Get lost, you savage!

728
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:16,033
Get lost!

729
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:24,833
Last summer we were in Singapore,
my husband and son.

730
00:55:24,873 --> 00:55:27,953
If I had known you were there, I would
have definitely come and met you.

731
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:29,433
Do you have a photograph
of your daughter?

732
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:30,673
Show me...

733
00:55:33,993 --> 00:55:35,753
Hey! where is he?

734
00:55:37,473 --> 00:55:39,793
If I call him, he's hitting me,
you go call him, yourself.

735
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,033
Hey! what is this..

736
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:43,393
What happened?

737
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:44,993
Hmm...

738
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:52,153
Ram has come.

739
00:55:53,593 --> 00:55:55,833
He is hiding over there.

740
00:56:23,993 --> 00:56:25,393
Hey, Janu

741
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:32,233
- Hi
- Hi

742
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:32,913
How are you?

743
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:34,273
- I am fine.
- How are you?

744
00:56:34,313 --> 00:56:35,713
- Hi, Janu
- Hi, Janu

745
00:56:37,513 --> 00:56:39,633
You didn't respond to my greeting

746
00:56:39,673 --> 00:56:40,873
Sorry...sorry

747
00:56:46,513 --> 00:56:48,713
How was the Vaitheeswaran temple?

748
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,313
It was nice.

749
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:55,393

772
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:34,153
Miss, you never called out
K.Ramachandran's name.

773
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:36,633
His name is not in the register.

774
00:57:36,673 --> 00:57:38,713
Maybe he is in some other department.

775
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,913
 Check it during the interval.

776
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:45,953
He's not here also.

777
00:57:45,993 --> 00:57:47,793
I thought he would
be in your class.

778
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:11,433
K.Ramachandran

779
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:14,193
He has taken his
Transfer Certificate.

780
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:15,713
Did you not know?

781
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:18,913
Why would he have taken the
Transfer Certificate?

782
00:58:19,353 --> 00:58:21,833
Hey! you call him your
brother, don't you know?

783
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,593
I promise I don't know anything.

784
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,113
I came back from Kumbakonam
only this morning.

785
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:31,473
Why, without telling us?
Just can't understand

786
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:36,153
Hey! nothing to worry!
Let's go to his house in the evening,

787
00:58:36,193 --> 00:58:37,753
Then everything will be clear.

788
00:58:54,873 --> 00:58:56,033
Brother!

789
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:58,473
What you doing there? It's locked.

790
00:58:59,153 --> 00:59:00,113
Ram?

791
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:01,033
What?

792
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:03,553
Krishnamoorthy uncle!

793
00:59:04,313 --> 00:59:05,553
 Isn't there anyone in the house?

794
00:59:05,593 --> 00:59:06,953
Krishnamoorthy is it?

795
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:09,353
How do I tell you that!

796
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:27,145
Apparently his dad was
in a lot of debt and...

797
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:31,745
wasn't able to return the money.
So they had to sell the house.

798
00:59:32,225 --> 00:59:34,425
It was built by his grandfather.

799
00:59:35,145 --> 00:59:37,425
So, they did not
want anyone to know.

800
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:42,305
That's why, they packed their bags
over night and left to Chennai.

801
00:59:45,385 --> 00:59:47,385
 No one knows anything else.

802
00:59:50,985 --> 00:59:56,505
Really sad, even he and his mother came
to know about it only that night.

803
00:59:59,945 --> 01:00:03,105
"Why..."

804
01:00:03,185 --> 01:00:09,625
"Did he leave without
saying anything?"

805
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,665
"Why..."

806
01:00:13,705 --> 01:00:20,145
"Did he not close
yesterday's chapter?"

807
01:00:20,265 --> 01:00:25,065
"In the Grey skies..."

808
01:00:25,145 --> 01:00:30,905
"I search for my clouds."

809
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:35,785
"The time is like a riddle,"

810
01:00:35,825 --> 01:00:41,425
"My path is filled with tears."

811
01:00:41,545 --> 01:00:46,985
"Far away it has gone..."

812
01:00:47,025 --> 01:00:52,225
"The music of love."

813
01:00:52,305 --> 01:00:57,625
"Every tear that drops,"

814
01:00:57,665 --> 01:01:03,745
"Is my prayer in search."

815
01:01:03,825 --> 01:01:09,025
"He left the town I heard"

816
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:14,345
"My eyes looked here and there."

817
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:19,745
"He left my very roots I realized"

818
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:24,185
"That truth caused mayhem within!"

819
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:28,905
"The music was over."

820
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:34,745
"Where is your silence?"

821
01:01:34,785 --> 01:01:45,305
"The burden of tears are becoming
my eternal companion."

822
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:50,345
"Tomorrow seems to burn."

823
01:01:50,385 --> 01:01:55,905
"Where is my morning?"

824
01:01:55,985 --> 01:02:00,865
"Wings are filled with rocks."

825
01:02:00,945 --> 01:02:06,665
"Till I die on the ground."

826
01:03:42,345 --> 01:03:43,505
Ram

827
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:51,785
Hi

828
01:03:53,985 --> 01:03:55,105
You recognize me?

829
01:03:55,145 --> 01:03:56,185
Janu.

830
01:04:00,665 --> 01:04:01,985
How are you Ram?

831
01:04:02,265 --> 01:04:04,465
I am fine.
How are you?

832
01:04:09,665 --> 01:04:11,465
This is unbelievable, right?

833
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:13,265
That we would meet like this.

834
01:04:14,865 --> 01:04:16,385
It's been 20 years.

835
01:04:17,185 --> 01:04:19,305
No actually 22 years.

836
01:04:23,305 --> 01:04:25,665
I can't recognize you at all.

837
01:04:27,345 --> 01:04:29,345
When we saw each other
the last time,

838
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,265
you did not even
have a moustache.

839
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,985
What are you doing now Ram?

840
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:40,105
Travel...

841
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:42,545
Travel photographer

842
01:05:07,865 --> 01:05:09,625
- What happen?
- I am ok.

843
01:05:09,665 --> 01:05:10,585
You keep quiet.

844
01:05:10,665 --> 01:05:12,585
Hey! I left the kid
with you for 5 minutes,

845
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:13,665
and look what you did.

846
01:05:13,825 --> 01:05:14,545
Thanks

847
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:15,985
You want anything else?

848
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:16,785
You sit down.

849
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:19,065
- First you drink the water.
- Ok I will drink.

850
01:05:19,705 --> 01:05:21,145
You're ok?

851
01:05:21,705 --> 01:05:24,305
She's come after so many years
and this is what you do!

852
01:05:26,545 --> 01:05:29,225
I slipped and fell.

853
01:05:29,265 --> 01:05:32,905
Did he say anything to you
or the minute he saw you...

854
01:05:35,705 --> 01:05:36,865
Sorry

855
01:05:39,585 --> 01:05:41,665
She has come all the
way from Singapore.

856
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:43,265
Can't you enquire about her?

857
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:44,825
Instead of behaving like a kid.

858
01:05:44,865 --> 01:05:48,465
She's married and has a daughter.
Did you ask her about all that?

859
01:05:48,505 --> 01:05:49,985
You're a real moron!

860
01:05:54,905 --> 01:05:56,425
Have you all eaten?

861
01:05:56,545 --> 01:05:58,025
Why have you not eaten?

862
01:05:58,105 --> 01:05:59,985
Normally I don't eat
anything on flights.

863
01:06:00,025 --> 01:06:01,585
Is it?

864
01:06:04,145 --> 01:06:06,905
Hey nutcase! Go run and
touch that tree and get back.

865
01:06:06,945 --> 01:06:08,145
- Go!
- Why?

866
01:06:10,025 --> 01:06:11,105
Okay.

867
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:12,665
Hello! Is it Dubai?

868
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:14,585
If you come back fast, run again.

869
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:15,505
Okay

870
01:06:17,305 --> 01:06:19,825
Hey! What is this?

871
01:06:20,305 --> 01:06:22,305
This is not right
am warning you

872
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:32,265
My dear sister in law,
is this a bribe for me or is it for...

873
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:36,745
My man's sister, take a walk slowly and
go touch that tree and come back.

874
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:37,985
Go.

875
01:07:04,465 --> 01:07:05,545
Thank you

876
01:07:07,145 --> 01:07:09,145
- You, not eating?
- No, you eat.

877
01:07:12,145 --> 01:07:13,105
Phone

878
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:52,785
Hey! Answer the call.

879
01:07:58,385 --> 01:07:59,305
Sir, yes, tell me sir.

880
01:07:59,345 --> 01:08:02,505
Hey! What is this?
They seem to be heading somewhere else.

881
01:08:03,065 --> 01:08:04,025
Yes sir.

882
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:06,065
Even I noticed sir.

883
01:08:06,465 --> 01:08:10,385
Looks like they have picked up,
from where they left, at school.

884
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:12,905
Yes sir, even I feel the same sir.

885
01:08:13,265 --> 01:08:15,065
Hope it doesn't
cause any problem.

886
01:08:15,105 --> 01:08:18,025
We come imagining one thing
and something else happens.

887
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:19,985
 Nothing like that will happen sir.

888
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:21,185
You don't worry.

889
01:08:26,425 --> 01:08:27,745
You haven't eaten.

890
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,025
Finish this.

891
01:08:31,745 --> 01:08:32,825
Thanks

892
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:32,985
- Hey!
- Hmm...

893
01:09:33,785 --> 01:09:35,425
What is happening there!

894
01:09:36,345 --> 01:09:37,665
How would I know?

895
01:09:39,065 --> 01:09:40,905
Nothing wrong will happen, no?

896
01:09:42,025 --> 01:09:44,505
- I am not thinking about that.
- Then?

897
01:09:45,665 --> 01:09:47,705
If something, happens
between these two here,

898
01:09:47,785 --> 01:09:49,905
and her husband back in
Singapore get's to know...

899
01:09:49,945 --> 01:09:52,985
If both of us being
the organizers, get caught

900
01:09:54,985 --> 01:09:59,705
Then it will be a real
celebration for us!

901
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:01,425
You shut up!

902
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:08,305
I thank all of you,
who have come.

903
01:10:08,545 --> 01:10:10,505
I have something to say,
to those who have not come,

904
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:14,305
you have missed a
beautiful opportunity in life.

905
01:10:14,385 --> 01:10:18,545
We don't know when and where, something
like this will happen again.

906
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:22,465
Finally on behalf of 'The All
Saint's School', batch of'96,

907
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:25,705
I invite our class favourite, Janu,

908
01:10:25,785 --> 01:10:28,585
on to the stage to say a few words.

909
01:10:28,705 --> 01:10:29,865
Our golden girl!

910
01:10:29,945 --> 01:10:31,305
Our kind hearted lioness!

911
01:10:31,345 --> 01:10:32,825
Our Singapore, Princess!

912
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:34,945
Thanjavur's dancing doll!

913
01:10:35,025 --> 01:10:36,905
We are all slaves to your songs!

914
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:38,625
Your walk is like a
chariot in procession!

915
01:10:38,665 --> 01:10:40,305
When you talk it's poetry!

916
01:10:40,345 --> 01:10:41,905
Janu, you speak my darling!

917
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:43,625
Hey! You keep quiet!

918
01:10:46,865 --> 01:10:48,225
I'm so happy

919
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,145
I feel I have
become half my age.

920
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,985
I came thinking everything
and everyone would have changed.

921
01:11:01,945 --> 01:11:03,505
But nothing has changed.

922
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:08,865
I feel like wearing my
blue and white uniform,

923
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:11,425
and go to school with
all of you again.

924
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:16,745
Thanks

925
01:11:16,785 --> 01:11:17,625
Hey Janu!

926
01:11:17,665 --> 01:11:19,265
Sing a song
before you leave.

927
01:11:22,505 --> 01:11:24,105
I just had an ice cream.

928
01:11:24,145 --> 01:11:27,145
That's okay.
Just sing, no one's giving you a prize.

929
01:11:29,705 --> 01:11:32,025
Hey Murali!

930
01:11:32,065 --> 01:11:35,145
Ask her to sing
'By the Banks of the river Yamuna...'

931
01:11:35,185 --> 01:11:36,425
How can I?

932
01:11:36,465 --> 01:11:37,305
Please...Please...

933
01:11:37,345 --> 01:11:40,705
Ask her to sing,
'By the Banks of the river Yamuna'

934
01:11:45,745 --> 01:11:53,465
"Without anyone saying anything
Flowers still emit fragrance."

935
01:11:53,665 --> 01:12:02,065
"Without any bond
Two hearts are speaking."

936
01:12:02,105 --> 01:12:10,385
"Without anyone saying anything
The bird's song oozes honey."

937
01:12:10,465 --> 01:12:18,705
"Without anything
The heart tastes, as sweet as ever!"

938
01:12:18,785 --> 01:12:26,785
"The water cascades through
And the world moves similarly."

939
01:12:26,985 --> 01:12:34,825
"Everything runs by
Similarly time passes by."

940
01:12:35,025 --> 01:12:43,905
"What doesn't stay still
Are the colours of the mind!"

941
01:13:00,305 --> 01:13:01,665
One

942
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:02,985
Two

943
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:04,425
Three

944
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:24,465
Hey! Anyone's got a handkerchief?

945
01:13:24,545 --> 01:13:25,705
Here it

946
01:13:28,345 --> 01:13:29,585
Okay, ready

947
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:34,905
Hey! look here.

948
01:13:36,825 --> 01:13:38,625
Did you see our protector?

949
01:13:41,465 --> 01:13:43,945
Hey! I am asking you,
did you see our protector?

950
01:13:44,025 --> 01:13:45,705
When are you coming back
again from Singapore?

951
01:13:45,745 --> 01:13:47,265
It will take some time.

952
01:13:47,305 --> 01:13:49,545
- Have you been there?
- No I haven't.

953
01:13:55,985 --> 01:13:57,585
I like your hair

954
01:13:57,665 --> 01:13:58,945
I like yours too

955
01:14:05,905 --> 01:14:10,025
You know, with what great difficulty,
I got permission for this place?

956
01:14:10,305 --> 01:14:11,825
It's really expensive!

957
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,865
These Chinese bulbs are expensive
too, you get them only in China.

958
01:14:14,905 --> 01:14:16,945
These caterers...

959
01:14:37,345 --> 01:14:39,305
My head is aching.

960
01:14:39,345 --> 01:14:41,065
Get me a coffee on the way.

961
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:42,905
Shall we leave,
the car has come.

962
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,065
Let's go.

963
01:14:54,225 --> 01:14:55,545
How long you staying in India?

964
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:58,225
Not staying, tomorrow early
morning is my flight.

965
01:14:58,265 --> 01:14:59,545
What's the hurry?

966
01:14:59,585 --> 01:15:01,985
In the last minute I did
not even get a ticket.

967
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,825
Only got a connecting flight.

968
01:15:03,905 --> 01:15:05,105
Have to go to Trichy and board.

969
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:07,505
You could have planned
to stay for 4 or 5 days.

970
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:11,305
Even I feel the same now.

971
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:12,745
Then what, stay and go.

972
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:15,825
I have left my daughter and come.
She won't be without me.

973
01:15:15,905 --> 01:15:18,065
- What's her name?
- Meera.

974
01:15:18,145 --> 01:15:19,225
Here take a look.

975
01:15:20,745 --> 01:15:21,945
 Hey! show me.

976
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,345
She looks very cute.

977
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:25,705
Hey! show me.

978
01:15:30,785 --> 01:15:32,025
It was taken there is it?

979
01:15:32,065 --> 01:15:34,785
Should visit these places
at least once before I die.

980
01:15:34,825 --> 01:15:35,785
Here.

981
01:15:47,185 --> 01:15:50,745
Hey Janu! he's checking out your
daughter, in front of you.

982
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:54,705
Does she look like me,
during our school days?

983
01:15:55,665 --> 01:15:57,425
Everyone says that.

984
01:15:57,985 --> 01:15:59,145
This is why brother,

985
01:15:59,185 --> 01:16:00,825
you should get married
at the right time.

986
01:16:00,865 --> 01:16:03,025
That's why you're still
looking at school kids.

987
01:16:03,065 --> 01:16:04,425
He still is not married?

988
01:16:04,505 --> 01:16:05,585
Nope

989
01:16:07,905 --> 01:16:10,345
Who will give their daughter's
hand to a wanderer!

990
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:12,425
Why you still not married?

991
01:16:16,025 --> 01:16:17,185
That is...

992
01:16:22,505 --> 01:16:23,665
Because...

993
01:16:24,225 --> 01:16:28,025
Dad's looking for a girl for me.

994
01:16:28,825 --> 01:16:31,865
Hey Ram! Take the car out.
We will come.

995
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:33,505
Okay! Okay!

996
01:16:33,705 --> 01:16:35,985
Finish your coffee.
I'll wait in the car.

997
01:16:37,065 --> 01:16:38,865
Hey! You finished your coffee?

998
01:16:38,945 --> 01:16:40,265
Your headache has gone?

999
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:41,225
Then get up.

1000
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:42,865
It's getting late. Give that.

1001
01:16:45,985 --> 01:16:46,585
Come

1002
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:47,905
I am asking you...

1003
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,025
What's his problem?

1004
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:49,665
Hey!

1005
01:16:49,745 --> 01:16:52,825
- All of you are with him, is it not?
- Hey! I messed up is it!

1006
01:16:53,105 --> 01:16:54,665
I am going on asking all of you.

1007
01:16:54,705 --> 01:16:57,065
One by one you guys are just
getting up and leaving.

1008
01:16:58,145 --> 01:16:59,745
You're always with
him, is it not?

1009
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:01,865
- Dad...
- What dad?

1010
01:17:04,465 --> 01:17:05,865
Sathish, am asking you

1011
01:17:05,905 --> 01:17:07,945
Why is he not married yet?

1012
01:17:07,985 --> 01:17:10,145
Since you're going with them

1013
01:17:10,185 --> 01:17:12,865
You drop her first
and then you get dropped.

1014
01:17:13,905 --> 01:17:14,705
What are you seeing there?

1015
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:16,225
Don't think too much.

1016
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:17,425
Go.

1017
01:17:29,425 --> 01:17:31,945
'Intermission'

1018
01:17:38,985 --> 01:17:40,745
Hey!
Which route are you taking?

1019
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:42,545
Don't you have to drop Janu, first?

1020
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:44,265
No, first I will drop you.

1021
01:17:44,345 --> 01:17:48,105
- Hey! That's a very long route.
- No, who told you, that's only shorter.

1022
01:17:49,105 --> 01:17:51,585
Yeah right! Adayar is closer
to Valasarawakkam and...

1023
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:52,945
far from St Thomas Mount is it?

1024
01:17:52,985 --> 01:17:54,145
Nonsense!

1025
01:17:54,225 --> 01:17:56,425
Shall I check Google
maps and tell you.

1026
01:17:56,465 --> 01:17:57,185
No use,

1027
01:17:57,225 --> 01:17:59,665
the routes he takes never
appear on the maps.

1028
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:02,905
Hey! Were you serious
or were you joking!

1029
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:04,625
I was serious only.

1030
01:18:13,345 --> 01:18:14,305
Careful.

1031
01:18:16,665 --> 01:18:18,065
Okay, bye

1032
01:18:18,105 --> 01:18:20,945
Am warning you, go drop
her right now, and get home!

1033
01:18:20,985 --> 01:18:22,945
- Understood?
- Don't have unnecessary thoughts.

1034
01:18:23,025 --> 01:18:24,505
Just a few words,
till I drop her, that's it.

1035
01:18:24,545 --> 01:18:25,745
Don't you know me.

1036
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:27,345
Get lost!

1037
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:31,065
Look at you and your white teeth.
Stop grinning like an idiot.

1038
01:18:32,225 --> 01:18:33,425
Bye

1039
01:18:33,785 --> 01:18:34,745
See you

1040
01:18:35,665 --> 01:18:36,625
Be careful.

1041
01:18:37,265 --> 01:18:38,665
Will let you know once
the baby is born.

1042
01:18:38,705 --> 01:18:40,265
Sure, do let me know.
Keep in touch.

1043
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:40,825
Okay.

1044
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:42,465
- Bye, take care
- Bye

1045
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,265
Janu...

1046
01:18:49,153 --> 01:18:53,233
So you will talk to me, only
if Subha is not around?

1047
01:18:58,193 --> 01:18:59,073
Ram.

1048
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,493
Why are you
still not married?

1049
01:19:07,373 --> 01:19:09,653
What's the hurry! I'll, slowly...

1050
01:19:09,893 --> 01:19:10,653
Ram

1051
01:19:11,053 --> 01:19:14,213
Am seriously asking you.
Why haven't you married as yet?

1052
01:19:16,093 --> 01:19:18,013
Let's say no one came forward.

1053
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:22,453
I am begging you Ram, please tell me.

1054
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:24,693
Even if it's because of me
it's okay,

1055
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:26,533
just tell me.
I need to know.

1056
01:19:26,573 --> 01:19:28,453
Tell me, why haven't
you married as yet?

1057
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:35,213
Ram.

1058
01:19:36,093 --> 01:19:37,813
Are you going to
tell me now or no?

1059
01:19:47,693 --> 01:19:49,293
Janu, we have
reached your hotel.

1060
01:19:56,493 --> 01:19:58,493
Ram, are you going
to drop me now?

1061
01:19:59,453 --> 01:20:00,413
No...no...

1062
01:20:01,493 --> 01:20:03,173
Subha told me to...

1063
01:20:03,213 --> 01:20:05,173
Don't you feel like
talking to me at all ?

1064
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:07,453
No... no..nothing like that.

1065
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:11,173
I will pick you up in the morning
and drop you at the airport.

1066
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,053
Take my number.

1067
01:20:34,715 --> 01:20:36,275
Janu, am not purposely...

1068
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:48,275
"Beautiful memories are becoming bitter."

1069
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:54,235
"Won't my distances ever vanish?"

1070
01:20:54,955 --> 01:21:01,395
"Yearnings of my soul
are tearing me apart!"

1071
01:21:01,475 --> 01:21:07,715
"Won't the past ever return?"

1072
01:21:08,555 --> 01:21:14,435
"Looking and yet not looking"

1073
01:21:14,635 --> 01:21:21,315
"Will my heart, forever live like that?"

1074
01:21:21,755 --> 01:21:27,675
"The cowardice of words are like..."

1075
01:21:27,755 --> 01:21:34,155
"The harp without a melody."

1076
01:21:34,355 --> 01:21:40,875
"Beautiful memories are becoming bitter."

1077
01:21:40,955 --> 01:21:47,555
"Won't my distances ever vanish?"

1078
01:22:43,275 --> 01:22:46,075
"Within the principles of love..."

1079
01:22:46,435 --> 01:22:49,795
"The rules are changing..."

1080
01:22:49,835 --> 01:22:52,915
"Emotions are taking over!!!"

1081
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:59,635
"My burdens are
disappearing into thin air."

1082
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:02,875
"The destination seems to
have a hundred paths..."

1083
01:23:02,955 --> 01:23:06,035
"To become one with you!!!"

1084
01:23:06,675 --> 01:23:13,035
"Shall I bask as the
moon of your love?"

1085
01:23:13,315 --> 01:23:19,715
"To be cheated in the break of dawn?"

1086
01:23:19,915 --> 01:23:25,955
"In this glorious night, come and live..."

1087
01:23:25,995 --> 01:23:32,955
"Hoping the dawn that
breaks is ours my love!!!"

1088
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,195
What is it, Janu?

1089
01:23:48,475 --> 01:23:49,275
Ram...

1090
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:52,315
Have you left?

1091
01:23:53,315 --> 01:23:55,035
Tell me Janu, you need anything?

1092
01:23:55,955 --> 01:23:57,235
No, where are you?

1093
01:23:57,995 --> 01:23:58,955
Janu?

1094
01:23:59,995 --> 01:24:01,315
Have you gone too far?...

1095
01:24:04,275 --> 01:24:05,875
Have you gone too far, Ram?

1096
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:10,235
I've been standing right
where I left you!!!

1097
01:24:57,315 --> 01:24:59,515
Is it wrong, that I
wanted to talk to you?

1098
01:24:59,835 --> 01:25:00,715
Sorry

1099
01:25:01,315 --> 01:25:02,715
22 years!!!...

1100
01:25:04,515 --> 01:25:05,475
Hey!

1101
01:25:19,635 --> 01:25:20,755
Thanks

1102
01:25:23,475 --> 01:25:24,475
Janu...

1103
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,715
Now tell me, where
do you want to go?

1104
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:35,595
- Yes Subha?
- Where are you?

1105
01:25:36,155 --> 01:25:37,995
- Near Guindy.
- Have you dropped her?

1106
01:25:38,035 --> 01:25:39,875
Yes. Dropped her
and am on my way.

1107
01:25:40,075 --> 01:25:41,355
Did she say anything?

1108
01:25:41,835 --> 01:25:44,515
Not really, as she was just
enquiring about my parents,

1109
01:25:44,995 --> 01:25:47,515
we reached the hotel,
I dropped her and left.

1110
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:48,835
Oh! Okay.

1111
01:25:49,795 --> 01:25:52,715
Alright! you don't keep thinking about
anything, go sleep.

1112
01:25:52,755 --> 01:25:54,395
I'll call you in the morning.

1113
01:26:06,555 --> 01:26:07,235
Hello

1114
01:26:07,275 --> 01:26:08,355
Where you?

1115
01:26:08,515 --> 01:26:10,195
I... I am in my room.

1116
01:26:11,435 --> 01:26:13,075
What time is your flight
tomorrow morning?

1117
01:26:13,115 --> 01:26:14,075
5.50 am.

1118
01:26:14,115 --> 01:26:15,915
You're going to Trichy and
leaving from there, is it?

1119
01:26:15,955 --> 01:26:18,235
Yes, from here to Trichy,
there to Singapore.

1120
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,315
Okay, call me after you reach.

1121
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:23,515
- At least text me.
- Okay, sure.

1122
01:26:23,555 --> 01:26:24,795
Okay, bye

1123
01:26:32,675 --> 01:26:34,355
Now tell me, where shall we go?

1124
01:26:34,755 --> 01:26:36,195
Let's go somewhere.

1125
01:26:36,995 --> 01:26:38,315
Somewhere...?

1126
01:26:38,635 --> 01:26:40,515
I really don't know,
you suggest.

1127
01:26:41,315 --> 01:26:42,875
Why you asking me?

1128
01:26:42,915 --> 01:26:45,035
How will I know?
Go, anywhere.

1129
01:26:48,395 --> 01:26:50,555
In moment of bravado, I asked you out.

1130
01:26:51,435 --> 01:26:52,995
Honestly, I've never been anywhere.

1131
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:54,715
You better suggest,
where to go.

1132
01:26:55,035 --> 01:26:56,595
Shall we go to a salon?

1133
01:26:58,635 --> 01:26:59,875
Salon?

1134
01:27:02,915 --> 01:27:06,355
"If you go inside the Nesapakam market,
the road will curve towards the left,"

1135
01:27:06,395 --> 01:27:07,715
then it divides into a fork,

1136
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:09,195
take the right there.

1137
01:27:09,275 --> 01:27:10,555
Stop intruding,

1138
01:27:10,595 --> 01:27:12,355
then how can you hear
what I am saying.

1139
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:15,035
So, after you take the right at the
fork, take the second right,

1140
01:27:15,115 --> 01:27:16,835
you will hit a corporation bank.

1141
01:27:17,195 --> 01:27:19,035
On the same road,
it's the third house.

1142
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:20,355
If you go ring the bell,

1143
01:27:20,395 --> 01:27:22,555
a nice, plump woman, will
come and open the door.

1144
01:27:23,435 --> 01:27:24,715
That's the owner's wife.

1145
01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:25,875
Yes.

1146
01:27:29,075 --> 01:27:30,035
Oh! the water is it?

1147
01:27:30,195 --> 01:27:31,475
It will be red in colour.

1148
01:27:31,595 --> 01:27:33,715
In Nesapakam, that's how the
colour of the water will be.

1149
01:27:33,755 --> 01:27:35,035
If you want crystal clear water,

1150
01:27:35,075 --> 01:27:36,995
you have tolook in places like
KK nagar and Valasarawakkam.

1151
01:27:37,075 --> 01:27:38,915
- Did you cut your hair anywhere else?
- No!

1152
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:40,555
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
I have an serious issue to deal with now.

1153
01:27:40,595 --> 01:27:41,675
- I know him from long back.
- I'll speak later

1154
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:42,835
I know him from long back?

1155
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:43,915
Is that how you would say it!

1156
01:27:43,955 --> 01:27:45,355
Shouldn't you say, you know me,

1157
01:27:45,395 --> 01:27:46,955
even before your beard blended
with your moustache?

1158
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:48,795
His father used to bring
him here, as a little boy,

1159
01:27:48,835 --> 01:27:50,075
and tell me to
cut it really short,

1160
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:51,595
and this one, used to tell
me to keep it long.

1161
01:27:51,635 --> 01:27:52,835
When he was new to Madras,

1162
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,355
whenever he saw a Thanjavur bus,

1163
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,475
he used to come here
and sit with a long face.

1164
01:27:56,515 --> 01:27:57,475
Brother!

1165
01:27:58,275 --> 01:27:59,515
Crazy boy!

1166
01:27:59,755 --> 01:28:01,435
Okay, tell me, how
should I cut his hair?

1167
01:28:03,515 --> 01:28:05,195
Like actors, Rajini or Kamal?

1168
01:28:05,235 --> 01:28:07,315
Or like Vijay or Ajith or like Surya?

1169
01:28:07,355 --> 01:28:08,435
That's why I am asking?

1170
01:28:08,915 --> 01:28:11,955
Uncle, cut his hair,
like a 10th standard boy.

1171
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,235
I am gone.

1172
01:28:23,915 --> 01:28:24,835
Which year?

1173
01:28:26,155 --> 01:28:27,435
'94.

1174
01:28:27,795 --> 01:28:28,955
Oh! okay!

1175
01:28:32,315 --> 01:28:33,555
Oh! '94 is it?

1176
01:28:35,715 --> 01:28:37,475
Should I really have to shave my beard?

1177
01:28:43,795 --> 01:28:44,995
Where you coming?

1178
01:28:45,075 --> 01:28:46,995
It's like a bear, it will
take time to sculpt.

1179
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:48,435
Sit and watch the fun.

1180
01:28:48,675 --> 01:28:50,835
- You sit down.
- You turn this side.

1181
01:29:08,595 --> 01:29:10,395
You have lost half your weight.

1182
01:29:21,595 --> 01:29:23,115
Don't close your eyes.

1183
01:29:44,675 --> 01:29:45,435
Okay?

1184
01:29:45,475 --> 01:29:46,475
Double okay

1185
01:29:46,515 --> 01:29:48,475
Okay you sit.
Let's put two plaits for you.

1186
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:49,635
Oh no! I don't want.

1187
01:29:50,195 --> 01:29:52,315
Okay, now leave the shop
I need to close it.

1188
01:29:52,355 --> 01:29:53,755
Okay you wait , I'll come now.

1189
01:29:56,675 --> 01:29:58,675
- Who did you think she is?
- I am wise enough.

1190
01:29:58,715 --> 01:29:59,595
I can understand everything.

1191
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:01,435
- What do you understand?
- I can understand.

1192
01:30:01,475 --> 01:30:03,075
That's what, what
do you understand?

1193
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:31,395
Shall we go?

1194
01:30:33,395 --> 01:30:34,475
Remove your shirt.

1195
01:30:36,755 --> 01:30:38,435
After all you're wearing
a T Shirt inside.

1196
01:30:38,515 --> 01:30:40,115
It has sleeves, right?

1197
01:30:41,515 --> 01:30:42,635
Then remove it.

1198
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:43,835
No...hmm...

1199
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,315
Hey! Just remove it!

1200
01:31:00,115 --> 01:31:01,155
See how this looks!

1201
01:31:01,435 --> 01:31:03,635
You and your beard and
the worn out shirt!

1202
01:31:14,395 --> 01:31:15,475
What?

1203
01:31:22,235 --> 01:31:23,395
What Janu?

1204
01:31:23,515 --> 01:31:24,475
Hey! hey! hey!

1205
01:31:24,555 --> 01:31:25,515
What?!!!

1206
01:31:25,795 --> 01:31:27,035
Hey! hey! Janu.

1207
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:28,155
What is it?

1208
01:31:30,715 --> 01:31:31,635
Ram

1209
01:31:33,595 --> 01:31:34,835
Are you a virgin?

1210
01:31:37,395 --> 01:31:38,875
Are you a virgin?

1211
01:31:38,915 --> 01:31:41,635
Yuck, is this way to ask, though?

1212
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:42,955
Is it true?

1213
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:46,995
After going to Singapore,
you have become spoilt...

1214
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:49,035
- Let's go now.
- That's alright.

1215
01:31:49,235 --> 01:31:50,675
You answer my question.

1216
01:31:53,435 --> 01:31:55,195
It's getting late, first
let us leave from here.

1217
01:31:55,235 --> 01:31:56,755
- Are you going to tell me or not?
- Hey! hey! hey!

1218
01:31:56,795 --> 01:31:59,195
My shirt is getting crushed.

1219
01:31:59,235 --> 01:31:59,875
Then answer me.

1220
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:01,875
Thought you can evade all
my questions and escape?

1221
01:32:01,955 --> 01:32:03,395
Now what do you want to know?

1222
01:32:03,475 --> 01:32:04,435
Whether...

1223
01:32:08,835 --> 01:32:11,675
Whatever be it, let's go
talk about it in the car.

1224
01:32:12,835 --> 01:32:13,875
Please Janu

1225
01:32:16,435 --> 01:32:17,155
Go.

1226
01:32:31,715 --> 01:32:32,755
Come, stand here.

1227
01:32:34,755 --> 01:32:35,635
Now, tell me.

1228
01:32:38,195 --> 01:32:39,955
Okay! Let me spit this out!

1229
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:42,475
First swear on God, and tell the truth.

1230
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:44,235
Janu, one shouldn't swear
about such things.

1231
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:45,115
Liar!

1232
01:32:45,235 --> 01:32:46,475
Don't I know about you.

1233
01:32:46,515 --> 01:32:49,755
You would have cooked up a story,
by the time you came from there to here.

1234
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:51,835
Swear on me.

1235
01:32:52,235 --> 01:32:53,275
Okay, now tell.

1236
01:33:14,315 --> 01:33:15,955
Yes! I am a virgin only, Janu.

1237
01:33:16,035 --> 01:33:17,275
Holy! Smokes!

1238
01:33:17,715 --> 01:33:20,355
You insisted, so I told.
Now just leave it at that.

1239
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,595
But why?

1240
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:24,035
Because I have committed to Lord Hanuman.
Now get into the car.

1241
01:33:24,075 --> 01:33:25,035
But how...

1242
01:33:25,675 --> 01:33:26,795
Now what do you want...

1243
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:29,075
Oh! Now your ego is
getting hurt is it?

1244
01:33:29,195 --> 01:33:31,515
Buffalo! Do you know
how old you are?

1245
01:33:35,555 --> 01:33:37,835
Please change the topic.
I am feeling very shy.

1246
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:41,875
Okay, leave that.

1247
01:33:42,115 --> 01:33:44,635
In all these years, have you
not fallen in love with anyone?

1248
01:33:47,515 --> 01:33:49,315
Can't really say that.

1249
01:33:50,395 --> 01:33:51,515
I was expecting this.

1250
01:33:51,555 --> 01:33:52,875
Finally the truth is coming out.

1251
01:33:53,235 --> 01:33:53,875
What?

1252
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:57,755
Girls, will really like guys like you.

1253
01:33:57,915 --> 01:33:59,195
How did they miss out?

1254
01:33:59,595 --> 01:34:01,555
- Guys, like, me?
- Yes!

1255
01:34:02,635 --> 01:34:04,315
What do you mean
by guys, like, me?

1256
01:34:04,435 --> 01:34:07,435
Hey! You're this raw, oozing
manhood, kinda guy!

1257
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,795
Why? Hasn't anyone told you this?

1258
01:34:15,195 --> 01:34:17,675
Okay, enough of smiling,
come to the story.

1259
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:22,035
- There was a girl called Charu.
- Full name?

1260
01:34:23,275 --> 01:34:24,075
Charumathi.

1261
01:34:25,795 --> 01:34:27,035
She was my junior in college.

1262
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:29,355
Nice girl. Beautiful to look at.

1263
01:34:29,395 --> 01:34:31,515
While studying in college, I had
no idea about her feelings.

1264
01:34:31,555 --> 01:34:33,795
After college got over,
one day she called on my landline,

1265
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,195
and wanted to talk to me.

1266
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:37,635
She said, her parents were
looking out for a groom for her.

1267
01:34:37,675 --> 01:34:39,155
I congratulated her on that.

1268
01:34:39,315 --> 01:34:40,475
She got angry.

1269
01:34:41,955 --> 01:34:43,915
After that she bluntly asked
if I was interested,

1270
01:34:43,955 --> 01:34:45,275
so she could talk to her parents.

1271
01:34:45,315 --> 01:34:46,355
What did you say?

1272
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:47,795
What to say?

1273
01:34:48,435 --> 01:34:50,075
For me to understand what she
was saying itself was...

1274
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:51,515
Okay. What did you say?

1275
01:34:52,115 --> 01:34:53,475
What do you expect me to say?

1276
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:56,355
I told her, that am
jobless, penniless, etc.

1277
01:34:56,395 --> 01:34:57,955
- Then? Then?
- She was stubborn.

1278
01:34:58,235 --> 01:34:59,555
I had no options left.

1279
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:00,995
Finally I told her the truth.

1280
01:35:01,035 --> 01:35:02,075
What is that?

1281
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:04,355
I told her about you.

1282
01:35:06,755 --> 01:35:08,155
She was silent for a while.

1283
01:35:08,555 --> 01:35:11,155
Then she took a deep
breath and left.

1284
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,915
After three months, she sent
me her wedding invitation.

1285
01:35:13,955 --> 01:35:15,195
Then she called me.

1286
01:35:15,755 --> 01:35:18,515
She told, forget what
happened and come for the wedding.

1287
01:35:18,555 --> 01:35:21,475
She said she will be
expecting me.

1288
01:35:21,795 --> 01:35:22,995
Did you go?

1289
01:35:24,155 --> 01:35:26,155
Whatever said and done, I am
someone she liked.

1290
01:35:26,195 --> 01:35:27,155
Poor thing.

1291
01:35:27,275 --> 01:35:29,115
I did not want to make her feel awkward.

1292
01:35:29,555 --> 01:35:30,355
So I did not go.

1293
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:43,835
Back then,

1294
01:35:44,355 --> 01:35:46,195
why you left without telling?

1295
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:50,395
Why did you not come to see me again?

1296
01:35:50,435 --> 01:35:52,195
Nothing made sense to me.

1297
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:55,795
I couldn't even ask anyone.

1298
01:35:57,115 --> 01:35:58,555
Neither could I forget you.

1299
01:36:01,195 --> 01:36:03,315
I completely neglected
my studies.

1300
01:36:03,915 --> 01:36:06,155
It was a miracle, that
I even passed my 12th.

1301
01:36:07,635 --> 01:36:10,315
I got scared my parents
would get me married,

1302
01:36:10,355 --> 01:36:12,115
so I completed my degree properly.

1303
01:36:12,915 --> 01:36:15,835
Even then, every time I met
any of our school friends...

1304
01:36:16,195 --> 01:36:17,875
I used to wait eagerly to see if,

1305
01:36:17,915 --> 01:36:19,755
they would say something about you.

1306
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:24,235
If someone like you,
tall and dark passed by,

1307
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,755
I would hope, it would be you
and follow them many times,

1308
01:36:27,795 --> 01:36:28,915
but in vain.

1309
01:36:31,555 --> 01:36:32,795
To add to all this..

1310
01:36:33,275 --> 01:36:35,755
my sister eloped
and got married.

1311
01:36:37,275 --> 01:36:40,755
Two months after that,
my marriage was fixed.

1312
01:36:42,395 --> 01:36:45,435
With the hatred my father was
harboring for my sister.

1313
01:36:45,715 --> 01:36:47,875
I could not even, go and
speak to him about anything.

1314
01:36:48,275 --> 01:36:50,435
Even if I had spoken,
what could have I told him?

1315
01:36:50,475 --> 01:36:52,635
That I was in love with a
guy till the 10th standard,

1316
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:55,075
but I don't know where he is now?

1317
01:37:00,675 --> 01:37:04,275
Even on my wedding day...

1318
01:37:04,915 --> 01:37:07,995
Something within told me,
you will come for me.

1319
01:37:09,715 --> 01:37:12,075
Now if I say all this, it
would sound very dramatic.

1320
01:37:12,635 --> 01:37:14,875
Even while I was seated as a bride,

1321
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:17,115
I felt your presence
in the wedding hall.

1322
01:37:17,555 --> 01:37:19,355
I thought, just like how
it happens in films.

1323
01:37:19,395 --> 01:37:20,955
You would stop the wedding,

1324
01:37:20,995 --> 01:37:24,595
and ask for your Janu.

1325
01:37:24,675 --> 01:37:27,195
I was hoping you would take me with you.

1326
01:37:30,035 --> 01:37:32,115
But, nothing like that happened.

1327
01:37:33,275 --> 01:37:34,795
Only my wedding took place.

1328
01:37:41,395 --> 01:37:44,315
After that I was heartbroken.

1329
01:37:47,555 --> 01:37:49,355
Till date...

1330
01:37:49,395 --> 01:37:51,035
whenever heart is heavy...

1331
01:37:51,355 --> 01:37:53,035
my only refuge...

1332
01:37:53,395 --> 01:37:55,995
is my 10th standard
K.Ramachandran's face.

1333
01:38:03,035 --> 01:38:04,275
What happened?

1334
01:38:04,835 --> 01:38:05,555
Sir,

1335
01:38:05,715 --> 01:38:07,635
it's getting late,
I have to close the gates.

1336
01:38:11,955 --> 01:38:14,155
If you take the car out,
I'll close the gates.

1337
01:38:18,235 --> 01:38:19,155
Sit down.

1338
01:38:48,755 --> 01:38:49,795
Sorry Ram.

1339
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:53,435
These are things I wanted to tell you,

1340
01:38:54,075 --> 01:38:55,515
someday when I meet you.

1341
01:38:57,235 --> 01:38:59,275
Who else can I share these things with.

1342
01:38:59,595 --> 01:39:01,115
That's why I poured
my heart out.

1343
01:39:01,475 --> 01:39:04,755
Please don't think I am trying
to make you feel guilty.

1344
01:39:04,795 --> 01:39:05,515
Okay?

1345
01:39:13,195 --> 01:39:14,155
No...

1346
01:39:18,915 --> 01:39:20,555
The fact that I came to your college...

1347
01:39:20,595 --> 01:39:23,075
and sent a message, saying that
I wanted to see you,

1348
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,275
don't you know any of that?

1349
01:39:26,475 --> 01:39:27,755
When did you come?

1350
01:39:30,755 --> 01:39:32,075
Don't tell lies, Ram.

1351
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:36,075
I came, Janu.

1352
01:39:38,035 --> 01:39:39,275
Don't play the fool, Ram.

1353
01:39:42,275 --> 01:39:43,355
Really, did you come?

1354
01:40:46,612 --> 01:40:47,572
One minute.

1355
01:40:48,412 --> 01:40:49,132
Ask her.

1356
01:40:49,452 --> 01:40:53,292
Please could you call Janaki Devi,
second year Bsc computer science.

1357
01:40:53,332 --> 01:40:54,852
I need to talk to her.

1358
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:57,332
Is it anything to do with love?

1359
01:40:57,372 --> 01:40:58,972
No sister, it's not what you think.

1360
01:40:59,092 --> 01:41:01,212
They both have been in
love, ever since school.

1361
01:41:01,252 --> 01:41:03,052
There happened to be a
break in the middle...

1362
01:41:03,092 --> 01:41:05,852
It's a ladies college, otherwise
we ourselves would have...

1363
01:41:06,012 --> 01:41:07,532
We have come all the
way from Madras.

1364
01:41:07,572 --> 01:41:08,812
Just inform her, that would do.

1365
01:41:08,852 --> 01:41:11,092
Just for this, have come
all the way from Madras?

1366
01:41:11,132 --> 01:41:12,092
Yes sister.

1367
01:41:12,172 --> 01:41:13,692
We both are classmates.

1368
01:41:14,492 --> 01:41:17,412
I feel bad for you guys.

1369
01:41:17,852 --> 01:41:19,252
I will help you.

1370
01:41:19,652 --> 01:41:21,052
Are you sure there
won't be any trouble?

1371
01:41:21,092 --> 01:41:22,692
No nothing will happen sister.

1372
01:41:23,132 --> 01:41:25,252
We just want to see her and
talk to her once. That's all.

1373
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:26,052
Please.

1374
01:41:26,292 --> 01:41:27,612
What did you say her name was?

1375
01:41:27,652 --> 01:41:29,012
S. Janaki.

1376
01:41:29,052 --> 01:41:30,012
One minute.

1377
01:41:31,172 --> 01:41:33,052
- Do you know her?
- I don't know.

1378
01:41:33,972 --> 01:41:35,892
Hey! Just write her
dad's name as well...

1379
01:41:35,932 --> 01:41:38,092
Our bad luck,
there could be two Janaki Devis.

1380
01:41:42,692 --> 01:41:44,812
You leave.
What did you say your name was?

1381
01:41:44,852 --> 01:41:45,972
K. Ramachandran.

1382
01:41:50,252 --> 01:41:51,732
Hey! Where are you going?

1383
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:12,652
Janaki Devi?

1384
01:42:13,372 --> 01:42:14,572
That's me.

1385
01:42:15,852 --> 01:42:16,932
His name...

1386
01:42:18,012 --> 01:42:21,052
There is one boy, waiting
outside, to meet you.

1387
01:42:27,092 --> 01:42:29,252
What? Are you a
messenger for love?

1388
01:42:30,092 --> 01:42:31,732
Are you coming to
college for this?

1389
01:42:32,532 --> 01:42:34,012
If you're not interested
in studying, tell me.

1390
01:42:34,052 --> 01:42:35,572
I will take you to
the principal and get you,

1391
01:42:35,612 --> 01:42:37,012
your Transfer Certificate.

1392
01:42:38,972 --> 01:42:39,692
Hey!

1393
01:42:40,532 --> 01:42:43,372
Next time you come to me,
carrying such messages...

1394
01:42:43,932 --> 01:42:45,332
I will give you one tight slap.

1395
01:42:54,732 --> 01:42:58,332
She saw you from there,
and yelled at me badly.

1396
01:43:03,332 --> 01:43:04,932
Don't know what the problem is.

1397
01:43:06,212 --> 01:43:07,412
Maybe...

1398
01:43:07,652 --> 01:43:09,892
If you had spoken to her directly,

1399
01:43:09,932 --> 01:43:11,932
things would have
been better, I suppose.

1400
01:43:23,332 --> 01:43:25,652
Just do me one more
favour, please.

1401
01:43:27,852 --> 01:43:30,052
Just tell her, I will
never trouble her again.

1402
01:43:30,212 --> 01:43:31,212
- Let's go.
- Hey!

1403
01:43:31,252 --> 01:43:32,532
Why you being hasty?

1404
01:43:32,772 --> 01:43:34,052
Let her come out,
we will talk to her directly.

1405
01:43:34,092 --> 01:43:34,892
No need.

1406
01:43:34,932 --> 01:43:36,572
No, anything could have
happened in these three years.

1407
01:43:36,612 --> 01:43:38,092
The least we can do is, to
not trouble her.

1408
01:43:38,132 --> 01:43:39,932
Hey, did we come so far,
just for this?

1409
01:43:47,692 --> 01:43:49,612
Sorry, I did not
ask you, for your name?

1410
01:43:49,652 --> 01:43:50,612
Vasanthi.

1411
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:51,532
Thanks

1412
01:43:51,572 --> 01:43:52,332
Get on.

1413
01:44:21,492 --> 01:44:22,852
Sir, come this side

1414
01:44:29,932 --> 01:44:32,452
- Which room?
- 318, third floor.

1415
01:44:52,212 --> 01:44:53,332
Don't come inside.

1416
01:44:53,372 --> 01:44:55,932
No...no...no... I won't ...am
standing outside the bedroom.

1417
01:44:58,332 --> 01:45:00,732
- Janu are you okay?
- Ram, I did not see you that day.

1418
01:45:02,852 --> 01:45:04,692
I...did not see you...

1419
01:45:12,452 --> 01:45:13,732
Okay...Okay...

1420
01:45:16,772 --> 01:45:19,532
I swear that day, I never saw you.

1421
01:45:22,452 --> 01:45:24,332
I never saw you.

1422
01:45:31,412 --> 01:45:32,892
I never saw you.

1423
01:45:33,092 --> 01:45:34,052
Never saw...

1424
01:45:36,012 --> 01:45:37,292
Never saw...

1425
01:45:42,252 --> 01:45:44,492
- Janaki Devi?
- That's me.

1426
01:45:45,492 --> 01:45:46,892
Hmm...his name?

1427
01:45:47,652 --> 01:45:50,692
One boy is waiting
outside to see you.

1428
01:46:21,612 --> 01:46:23,852
What are you?
A messenger for love?

1429
01:46:24,452 --> 01:46:26,252
Are you coming to
college for this?

1430
01:46:27,092 --> 01:46:30,212
Once more, you come with
any such messages...

1431
01:46:30,532 --> 01:46:32,532
I will give you one tight slap!

1432
01:46:58,132 --> 01:47:00,132
If we were not meant
to be together...

1433
01:47:00,772 --> 01:47:01,732
then why...

1434
01:47:05,212 --> 01:47:06,172
And look at you,

1435
01:47:06,492 --> 01:47:08,372
because of me, you're
also in this state...

1436
01:47:11,252 --> 01:47:13,052
First of all, how
could I believe,

1437
01:47:14,132 --> 01:47:15,532
that you would hate me.

1438
01:47:18,212 --> 01:47:20,372
Whatever it was, I should have,

1439
01:47:20,452 --> 01:47:21,892
waited and seen you.
I was hasty.

1440
01:47:21,932 --> 01:47:24,532
That day, if only that girl had
mentioned your name...

1441
01:47:26,252 --> 01:47:28,092
Everything would
have been different!

1442
01:47:29,092 --> 01:47:30,612
It's all my fate.

1443
01:47:36,212 --> 01:47:38,372
Why should we get to
know the truth now?

1444
01:47:39,372 --> 01:47:42,452
What we believed to be the truth,
could have remained the actual truth.

1445
01:47:43,292 --> 01:47:45,212
You have also been thinking about me.

1446
01:47:46,492 --> 01:47:49,092
I would have never known
that you came to see me.

1447
01:47:50,932 --> 01:47:53,652
In this pain, that is soothing.

1448
01:48:05,332 --> 01:48:07,732
How come you never said
anything when you were with me,

1449
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:11,012
but out of the blue, decided to
come after three years to say it?

1450
01:48:12,212 --> 01:48:14,252
Actually, every day I
used to think of it.

1451
01:48:14,852 --> 01:48:16,452
But something will stop me.

1452
01:48:17,132 --> 01:48:19,052
That I am not fair skinned like Janu.

1453
01:48:19,652 --> 01:48:21,612
I can't sing like Janu.

1454
01:48:22,612 --> 01:48:24,172
I used to keep
thinking like that.

1455
01:48:25,132 --> 01:48:27,132
That particular day,
I don't know what happened.

1456
01:48:27,172 --> 01:48:29,012
I felt like I would die
if I don't tell you.

1457
01:48:29,532 --> 01:48:31,692
Some courage within me that
day, like never before.

1458
01:48:32,092 --> 01:48:35,292
I travelled, all the way to your college
and was standing there, for you.

1459
01:48:35,612 --> 01:48:36,892
I wanted to ask you.

1460
01:48:37,692 --> 01:48:40,252
How did you know I was
studying in that college?

1461
01:48:40,572 --> 01:48:41,852
What kind of question is this?

1462
01:48:42,252 --> 01:48:43,332
Somehow I know.

1463
01:48:43,892 --> 01:48:45,012
But how?

1464
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:47,172
After all you were in Madras.

1465
01:48:50,252 --> 01:48:51,692
I had different people
for everything.

1466
01:48:51,772 --> 01:48:54,092
I used to come to know everything,
that happens to you.

1467
01:48:55,332 --> 01:48:57,492
If I felt like seeing you,
I would come to Thanjavur.

1468
01:48:57,692 --> 01:49:01,452
I would follow you,
from college back home,

1469
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:04,092
and if I came too close,
I would go hide.

1470
01:49:07,132 --> 01:49:08,572
The only thing, that I did not know,

1471
01:49:08,612 --> 01:49:11,892
was that you saw someone else and
not me that day and got angry.

1472
01:49:11,972 --> 01:49:14,092
Apart from that I know
everything about you.

1473
01:49:14,452 --> 01:49:16,572
What do you know?
Let me hear it.

1474
01:49:17,492 --> 01:49:19,292
If you say anything wrong...

1475
01:49:19,332 --> 01:49:21,492
Your 10th standard marks were 836.
Your 12th standard marks were 990.

1476
01:49:21,532 --> 01:49:22,652
Your b'day dress you would
wear it on my b'day!

1477
01:49:22,692 --> 01:49:23,612
Your favourite deity is lord Muruga!

1478
01:49:23,652 --> 01:49:24,812
You stop singing after I left town.

1479
01:49:24,852 --> 01:49:25,892
You wanted to study Tamil Literature,

1480
01:49:25,932 --> 01:49:27,612
but your father paid up
for Bsc Computer Science.

1481
01:49:27,652 --> 01:49:29,372
You did not eat
for two days because of that.

1482
01:49:29,412 --> 01:49:31,292
Your father was never aware of that.

1483
01:49:31,332 --> 01:49:34,892
I meant to say, your father
did not know, but I knew.

1484
01:49:36,772 --> 01:49:38,652
In 1998 you had typhoid and,

1485
01:49:38,692 --> 01:49:39,812
in 2000 you had jaundice.

1486
01:49:39,852 --> 01:49:42,052
The timing was so bad, both the,
times was when you had exams.

1487
01:49:42,092 --> 01:49:43,652
Remember, when you were in college,

1488
01:49:43,692 --> 01:49:45,372
one curly haired loafer was stalking you.

1489
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:46,452
He who was beaten up by someone,

1490
01:49:46,492 --> 01:49:48,372
and admitted in hospital,
which also became a police case?

1491
01:49:48,412 --> 01:49:49,772
It was me, who had hit him.

1492
01:49:51,212 --> 01:49:52,252
I only hit him.

1493
01:49:59,452 --> 01:50:02,492
Around that time, apart from me, three
other guys were in love with you.

1494
01:50:02,532 --> 01:50:04,332
Then, for your
college annual day,

1495
01:50:05,132 --> 01:50:07,092
for the first time you
wore a saree and came.

1496
01:50:07,772 --> 01:50:08,972
Dark blue in colour.

1497
01:50:10,652 --> 01:50:12,892
You were scared that your
saree may come out and,

1498
01:50:12,932 --> 01:50:14,532
at the same time you were blushing,

1499
01:50:14,572 --> 01:50:16,372
as though everyone was looking at you.

1500
01:50:18,292 --> 01:50:19,932
Do you know how you looked...

1501
01:50:27,892 --> 01:50:29,172
Do it once more.

1502
01:50:50,772 --> 01:50:53,412
After that I saw you in a
saree only at your wedding.

1503
01:50:56,372 --> 01:50:57,692
Deep purple in colour.

1504
01:51:04,252 --> 01:51:07,252
Just like you had thought, I had
come for your wedding, Janu!

1505
01:51:14,692 --> 01:51:17,012
I was standing in a
corner amidst the crowd.

1506
01:51:25,692 --> 01:51:28,972
I just couldn't wait till
the knot was tied.

1507
01:51:37,212 --> 01:51:39,212
I ran as far away as possible,

1508
01:51:39,692 --> 01:51:44,612
from the wedding hall
and all that noise.

1509
01:52:15,452 --> 01:52:16,372
Coffee?

1510
01:52:25,852 --> 01:52:26,772
- Come
- Hello, sir

1511
01:52:26,812 --> 01:52:27,652
Sorry sir, is it too late?

1512
01:52:27,692 --> 01:52:29,372
No, you are right on time.
Leave it.

1513
01:52:33,052 --> 01:52:34,772
- Shall I pour, sir?
- No, no, I'll do it.

1514
01:52:34,852 --> 01:52:36,092
- Okay sir
- Thanks

1515
01:52:54,772 --> 01:52:55,812
Okay Janu, I'll leave.

1516
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:56,932
After you drink, get some sleep.

1517
01:52:56,972 --> 01:52:59,292
I'll come at 3.30, you get ready
and come down. Okay.

1518
01:53:01,372 --> 01:53:03,572
I want to speak to you about
something, come here.

1519
01:53:04,092 --> 01:53:06,132
No...no... whatever it is, you
say it from there.

1520
01:53:06,172 --> 01:53:07,732
Nonsense, come and sit down.

1521
01:53:15,212 --> 01:53:17,892
It's taken me 22 years to
see this idiotic face.

1522
01:53:18,852 --> 01:53:20,252
That too, just for a night.

1523
01:53:22,012 --> 01:53:23,972
I should really
thank God for this.

1524
01:53:25,492 --> 01:53:26,812
I will do that tomorrow.

1525
01:53:27,572 --> 01:53:29,532
Don't tell me to sleep tonight.

1526
01:53:32,052 --> 01:53:33,372
I want to be with you.

1527
01:53:33,612 --> 01:53:34,892
I want to talk to you.

1528
01:53:35,532 --> 01:53:36,492
That's all.

1529
01:53:36,612 --> 01:53:37,412
Okay

1530
01:53:39,852 --> 01:53:40,732
What?

1531
01:54:05,132 --> 01:54:11,852
"Yearnings take shape and touch me..."

1532
01:54:11,892 --> 01:54:14,452
"Burning the beauty..."

1533
01:54:15,332 --> 01:54:19,492
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1534
01:54:19,532 --> 01:54:24,852
"The language of the eyes, follow
a path which leads to the story."

1535
01:54:25,572 --> 01:54:32,212
"Yearnings take shape and touch me..."

1536
01:54:32,292 --> 01:54:34,572
"Burning the beauty..."

1537
01:54:35,812 --> 01:54:39,972
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1538
01:54:40,052 --> 01:54:41,572
"The language of the eyes,"

1539
01:54:41,612 --> 01:54:44,932
"and the language
of the lips form a never ending story."

1540
01:54:45,132 --> 01:54:49,732
"Won't time become a horse at night?"

1541
01:54:50,052 --> 01:54:55,372
"Same dream! Same question!"

1542
01:54:55,412 --> 01:54:59,652
"Won't the skies caress
and embrace and dance?"

1543
01:55:00,252 --> 01:55:05,852
"The same moon, is coming closer."

1544
01:55:06,532 --> 01:55:13,212
"Yearnings take shape and touch me..."

1545
01:55:13,292 --> 01:55:15,692
"Burning the beauty..."

1546
01:55:16,732 --> 01:55:20,892
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1547
01:55:20,932 --> 01:55:22,932
"The language of the eyes,"

1548
01:55:23,012 --> 01:55:26,492
"and the language of the lips
form a never ending story."

1549
01:56:28,812 --> 01:56:33,412
"Am I the fire that gets wet?"

1550
01:56:33,452 --> 01:56:38,172
"Are you the raining moon?"

1551
01:56:38,932 --> 01:56:43,532
"Will I be extinguished?"

1552
01:56:44,172 --> 01:56:47,492
"Am I the waning musical note?"

1553
01:56:49,292 --> 01:56:52,892
"Is love just a never ending dream?"

1554
01:56:53,932 --> 01:56:59,252
"Is the never ending
journey not enough?"

1555
01:56:59,372 --> 01:57:03,852
"Is time a question alone?"

1556
01:57:03,892 --> 01:57:05,172
"That is enough."

1557
01:57:05,252 --> 01:57:10,092
"My heart melts in longing to come
closer to you."

1558
01:57:10,652 --> 01:57:17,412
"Yearnings take shape
and touch me..."

1559
01:57:17,492 --> 01:57:20,252
"Burning the beauty..."

1560
01:57:20,932 --> 01:57:25,052
"Cradling me like a mother!"

1561
01:57:25,132 --> 01:57:27,092
"The language of the eyes,"

1562
01:57:27,132 --> 01:57:30,812
"and the language of the lips
form a never ending story."

1563
01:57:50,052 --> 01:57:51,012
Oh God!

1564
01:57:51,332 --> 01:57:53,212
- What happened?
- My students.

1565
01:57:57,892 --> 01:57:59,212
Okay.
So, what?

1566
01:57:59,252 --> 01:58:00,212
What?

1567
01:58:00,292 --> 01:58:02,052
If they see us together...

1568
01:58:02,252 --> 01:58:04,212
Okay, just check if they
are looking this side.

1569
01:58:06,932 --> 01:58:09,212
They aren't looking, but
they are leaving now.

1570
01:58:10,732 --> 01:58:12,892
But, don't they have to go out this way?

1571
01:58:13,012 --> 01:58:13,972
Oh! Yeah!

1572
01:58:14,532 --> 01:58:16,132
Okay, I will go and
hide in the bathroom,

1573
01:58:16,172 --> 01:58:17,812
will you call me,
after they leave?

1574
01:58:17,852 --> 01:58:18,772
Please

1575
01:58:19,132 --> 01:58:20,052
Thanks

1576
01:58:25,092 --> 01:58:26,452
Sir this is the kitchen.

1577
01:58:26,492 --> 01:58:28,372
- Bathroom
- Washroom is there.

1578
01:58:39,932 --> 01:58:41,252
Hi, sir

1579
01:58:41,812 --> 01:58:44,252
This look, is stunning!

1580
01:58:44,292 --> 01:58:46,292
I couldn't recognize
you from there.

1581
01:58:46,332 --> 01:58:48,332
I thought it was some young guy.

1582
01:58:48,412 --> 01:58:49,652
What are you doing
here at this hour?

1583
01:58:49,692 --> 01:58:50,972
Sir it's Abhi's b'day,

1584
01:58:51,332 --> 01:58:53,372
so we came to cut cake.

1585
01:58:54,012 --> 01:58:55,052
Learn everything properly.

1586
01:58:55,092 --> 01:58:56,052
Okay?

1587
01:58:56,252 --> 01:58:59,132
Won't your parents, say anything,
you being out at this hour?

1588
01:58:59,892 --> 01:59:01,452
All of you have come
alone at this hour?

1589
01:59:01,492 --> 01:59:02,732
Go reach home safely.

1590
01:59:02,772 --> 01:59:04,492
Sir, is that your wife?

1591
01:59:12,012 --> 01:59:14,292
Hey! I never said anything...
I never said anything.

1592
01:59:14,972 --> 01:59:16,732
We are Ram sir's students.

1593
01:59:17,412 --> 01:59:20,652
I know, he just told me.

1594
01:59:20,692 --> 01:59:23,332
Actually, we had no clue
that sir is married.

1595
01:59:23,372 --> 01:59:24,572
He never told us.

1596
01:59:25,852 --> 01:59:27,892
I never said anything.

1597
01:59:29,452 --> 01:59:30,812
Nothing like that.

1598
01:59:30,892 --> 01:59:33,492
Because it was a love marriage,
we did not tell anyone.

1599
01:59:33,532 --> 01:59:35,012
Love marriage!!! Is it?

1600
01:59:35,052 --> 01:59:36,172
Why?
What happened?

1601
01:59:36,212 --> 01:59:38,812
We can't believe that he is married even.

1602
01:59:38,852 --> 01:59:41,172
And now you're saying
it was a love marriage.

1603
01:59:41,772 --> 01:59:44,172
So mean! Why you saying this?

1604
01:59:44,212 --> 01:59:46,652
Since, he is so
strict in class.

1605
01:59:46,692 --> 01:59:49,852
We can't talk, we can't look at each
other, and we can't even laugh.

1606
01:59:51,212 --> 01:59:52,732
Hey! That's enough!

1607
01:59:52,772 --> 01:59:55,012
You will go on talking...
Leave...leave...leave now...

1608
01:59:55,052 --> 01:59:56,572
- Why you threatening them?
- It's getting late.

1609
01:59:56,612 --> 01:59:58,132
Come, all of you come and sit.

1610
02:00:20,987 --> 02:00:23,027
Look at him ma'am, even
in front of you...

1611
02:00:23,107 --> 02:00:24,827
I will take care of
that, you continue.

1612
02:00:24,987 --> 02:00:26,747
- Where did I stop?
- Shouldn't laugh.

1613
02:00:26,787 --> 02:00:28,627
Oh yes, we shouldn't laugh...

1614
02:00:28,747 --> 02:00:30,387
we shouldn't even wear sleeveless...

1615
02:00:30,787 --> 02:00:32,747
Even my father is better than this, ma'am.

1616
02:00:33,787 --> 02:00:35,387
Okay, okay...he's like that only.

1617
02:00:35,547 --> 02:00:38,267
I will tell him to be more
gentle with girls, okay?

1618
02:00:38,307 --> 02:00:40,627
That's alright ma'am, but
how did sir fall in love?

1619
02:00:41,667 --> 02:00:45,267
Our love started, way back
from our school days,

1620
02:00:45,427 --> 02:00:46,667
from the 10th standard.

1621
02:00:46,707 --> 02:00:47,987
School days is it?

1622
02:00:50,547 --> 02:00:52,587
Who proposed first, ma'am?

1623
02:00:57,947 --> 02:01:00,107
Sir, you're feeling shy?

1624
02:01:04,867 --> 02:01:07,027
Ma'am, when did you
accept, the proposal?

1625
02:01:07,347 --> 02:01:09,267
The same day, at that
very moment...

1626
02:01:09,587 --> 02:01:10,547
at once!!!

1627
02:01:11,067 --> 02:01:11,867
What is this ma'am!

1628
02:01:11,907 --> 02:01:14,387
For your beauty, you should have
made him, chase you for a week.

1629
02:01:14,427 --> 02:01:17,947
That too sir, you could have
kept him waiting for a month.

1630
02:01:20,587 --> 02:01:23,827
At that time he meant
everything to me.

1631
02:01:24,747 --> 02:01:25,827
Even now!

1632
02:01:27,267 --> 02:01:30,907
Please ma'am, tell us
how sir proposed?

1633
02:01:31,467 --> 02:01:33,867
We won't ask you anything else,
we will leave.

1634
02:01:35,267 --> 02:01:37,227
Birthday wish, please

1635
02:01:41,187 --> 02:01:43,147
Tenth standard, went
by very merrily.

1636
02:01:43,227 --> 02:01:44,587
I was always smiling.

1637
02:01:44,947 --> 02:01:48,587
After that, Ram left to Madras suddenly.

1638
02:01:48,907 --> 02:01:50,107
Without even telling me.

1639
02:01:50,707 --> 02:01:52,467
All the smiles turned to tears.

1640
02:01:53,267 --> 02:01:55,867
Even after I joined college,
I could never forget him.

1641
02:01:56,187 --> 02:01:57,507
It used to be very painful.

1642
02:01:58,027 --> 02:02:00,507
But something within kept telling me,

1643
02:02:01,027 --> 02:02:03,227
my Ram, will come one day.

1644
02:02:03,507 --> 02:02:04,987
He will definitely come for me.

1645
02:02:05,547 --> 02:02:09,187
Sometimes though nothing
happens around you,

1646
02:02:10,067 --> 02:02:12,667
you will still have a gut feeling
that something is going to happen.

1647
02:02:12,707 --> 02:02:14,227
That's how I was feeling that day!

1648
02:02:29,227 --> 02:02:30,427
Excuse me, just a minute.

1649
02:02:30,787 --> 02:02:33,187
2nd year Bsc Computer Science,
S. Janaki Devi,

1650
02:02:33,227 --> 02:02:34,787
can you please call her.
I need to talk to her.

1651
02:02:34,827 --> 02:02:35,787
Is it about love?

1652
02:02:36,147 --> 02:02:37,107
Yes.

1653
02:02:37,627 --> 02:02:39,427
Are you sure there
won't be any trouble?

1654
02:02:39,547 --> 02:02:40,587
What's your name?

1655
02:02:40,747 --> 02:02:41,627
Vasanthi.

1656
02:02:41,667 --> 02:02:43,067
Vasanthi, you don't get scared.

1657
02:02:43,107 --> 02:02:45,667
Just go tell S. Janaki Devi
of 2nd year Bsc Computer Science,

1658
02:02:45,707 --> 02:02:47,907
that K. Ramachandran has come.

1659
02:02:48,747 --> 02:02:50,547
Vasanthi, thanks

1660
02:02:58,307 --> 02:02:59,787
S.Janaki Devi?

1661
02:03:01,547 --> 02:03:05,267
Someone called K.Ramachandran
is waiting for you.

1662
02:03:05,907 --> 02:03:07,867
What happened after
that, is something,

1663
02:03:08,027 --> 02:03:12,227
which I yearned, that it would happen
in my dreams atleast.

1664
02:03:13,587 --> 02:03:15,347
My Ram, had come in search of me.

1665
02:03:16,027 --> 02:03:18,147
In one second my
world had changed.

1666
02:03:19,147 --> 02:03:21,227
The minute I heard
K.Ramachandran's name,

1667
02:03:21,587 --> 02:03:23,787
my entire being shook!

1668
02:03:24,347 --> 02:03:26,227
I couldn't even walk,

1669
02:03:26,707 --> 02:03:28,187
but, I was running.

1670
02:03:31,067 --> 02:03:33,387
"Come to me my entirety!!!"

1671
02:03:33,747 --> 02:03:38,187
"You ..."

1672
02:03:39,787 --> 02:03:44,747
"Are my seven musical notes..."

1673
02:03:45,867 --> 02:03:50,987
"My Five great elements..."

1674
02:03:51,307 --> 02:03:55,827
"My heart is brimming!!!"

1675
02:03:56,307 --> 02:04:00,867
"Whatever I see..."

1676
02:04:03,387 --> 02:04:07,947
"Is love..."

1677
02:04:11,547 --> 02:04:13,507
I was seeing him
after three years.

1678
02:04:14,027 --> 02:04:15,947
The school boy face had gone.

1679
02:04:16,427 --> 02:04:19,987
A Lion of a man, with a beard
and a moustache, was at the gates!!!

1680
02:04:20,467 --> 02:04:21,467
For me.

1681
02:04:21,587 --> 02:04:22,827
For Janu.

1682
02:04:36,267 --> 02:04:38,227
But, I had by hearted
certain questions,

1683
02:04:38,267 --> 02:04:41,627
which I desperately wanted to
ask the day I see him.

1684
02:04:43,347 --> 02:04:44,547
But...

1685
02:04:48,387 --> 02:04:49,467
Janu!

1686
02:05:11,227 --> 02:05:13,587
"Love... Love..."

1687
02:05:13,667 --> 02:05:15,947
"Is the biggest lonely companion!"

1688
02:05:15,987 --> 02:05:18,427
"Come with me...
Come with me..."

1689
02:05:18,467 --> 02:05:20,907
"That is more than enough."

1690
02:05:20,987 --> 02:05:23,347
"Love... Love..."

1691
02:05:23,387 --> 02:05:25,747
"Till the end of life..."

1692
02:05:25,787 --> 02:05:31,187
"Lets travel...
Come with me.!!!"

1693
02:05:32,027 --> 02:05:34,027
Okay, enough of listening to stories.
It's getting late.

1694
02:05:34,067 --> 02:05:36,107
You people should leave.
Leave...leave...leave...

1695
02:05:40,827 --> 02:05:42,067
Hey! come here.

1696
02:05:43,707 --> 02:05:46,067
Can't you be happy cutting a cake
at 10pm back at home?

1697
02:05:46,107 --> 02:05:47,987
Is it a must to come
out and cut at 12pm?

1698
02:05:48,507 --> 02:05:50,507
Okay, leave now. Go reach
safely and text me.

1699
02:05:50,547 --> 02:05:53,067
- You both look made for each other, sir.
- Shut up! Leave!

1700
02:05:53,867 --> 02:05:54,827
Chatter box!

1701
02:05:56,107 --> 02:05:57,867
- Hey!
- I will take care. You leave.

1702
02:05:58,187 --> 02:05:59,387
You want a special
invitation is it?

1703
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:00,147
Leave!

1704
02:06:01,107 --> 02:06:02,227
Good night, Ma'am

1705
02:06:07,307 --> 02:06:08,387
Good night, sir

1706
02:06:08,827 --> 02:06:09,747
Good night

1707
02:06:10,307 --> 02:06:11,267
Leave.

1708
02:06:28,907 --> 02:06:30,227
Where next?

1709
02:06:32,547 --> 02:06:34,907
If you won't mistake me,
I want to ask you something?

1710
02:06:34,947 --> 02:06:37,707
Oooooh! What is it?

1711
02:06:40,147 --> 02:06:42,187
Your hotel is far off from here.

1712
02:06:42,227 --> 02:06:43,787
Okay.

1713
02:06:44,867 --> 02:06:47,507
No, it's alright, let's go.

1714
02:06:47,587 --> 02:06:49,067
Stop it, and just say it.

1715
02:06:51,787 --> 02:06:53,627
It's just that, the
hotel is far from here,

1716
02:06:53,987 --> 02:06:55,707
where as my house is close by.

1717
02:06:59,387 --> 02:07:01,067
What did you think about me, Ram?

1718
02:07:01,547 --> 02:07:03,707
No...no... sorry...sorry..

1719
02:07:03,787 --> 02:07:05,547
I did not mean it
that sense, Janu.

1720
02:07:05,907 --> 02:07:06,947
I promise.

1721
02:07:07,027 --> 02:07:08,587
That's why I was hesitant
to ask earlier.

1722
02:07:08,627 --> 02:07:10,947
Okay let's go to the hotel.
Shall I book a cab?

1723
02:07:12,267 --> 02:07:13,027
I promise...

1724
02:07:13,067 --> 02:07:15,427
There is this woman who
tries to entice sage Vishwamitra...

1725
02:07:15,467 --> 02:07:16,707
What's her name?

1726
02:07:18,067 --> 02:07:19,107
Menaka.

1727
02:07:19,507 --> 02:07:22,147
Yeah, and with her there
will two more women...

1728
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:23,667
What are their names?

1729
02:07:25,107 --> 02:07:26,507
Ramba and Urvashi.

1730
02:07:26,587 --> 02:07:27,547
Yeah.

1731
02:07:27,827 --> 02:07:30,027
Well, we can entrust you with
those three women,

1732
02:07:30,067 --> 02:07:31,907
in those same minimalistic outfits,
for a night!!!

1733
02:07:31,947 --> 02:07:33,187
You won't do anything majorly,

1734
02:07:33,227 --> 02:07:35,267
in fact, you will take
care of them safely.

1735
02:07:42,027 --> 02:07:44,507
That's because I've shaved off
my beard and moustache,

1736
02:07:44,547 --> 02:07:45,627
you're feeling that way.

1737
02:07:45,667 --> 02:07:47,347
Oh! really... and if
you hadn't shaved?

1738
02:07:47,867 --> 02:07:49,427
Even then you will
feel the same.

1739
02:07:50,507 --> 02:07:51,827
Okay, let's walk.

1740
02:07:51,987 --> 02:07:53,547
How do we go to your house?

1741
02:08:00,627 --> 02:08:01,787
Come let's go.

1742
02:08:08,587 --> 02:08:10,187
That side. That one.

1743
02:08:17,187 --> 02:08:19,947
Hey!
Any girls as neighbours?

1744
02:08:19,987 --> 02:08:21,187
Yes there are.

1745
02:08:22,347 --> 02:08:23,787
Come in with your right foot.

1746
02:08:23,867 --> 02:08:25,307
You're something...

1747
02:08:50,187 --> 02:08:52,067
K.Ramachandran's house, is it?

1748
02:08:54,587 --> 02:08:57,227
- Oh no! It's become wet.
- That's alright.

1749
02:08:58,947 --> 02:09:00,787
The house is nice.

1750
02:09:01,627 --> 02:09:02,627
Where is the bathroom?

1751
02:09:02,667 --> 02:09:04,307
Go straight and the bedroom is on the left.

1752
02:09:04,347 --> 02:09:06,107
You go, I will get a
towel and come.

1753
02:09:31,867 --> 02:09:35,387
Janu, shall I leave the soap and
towel here, at a reachable distance?

1754
02:09:35,427 --> 02:09:37,067
Why? There is one here.

1755
02:09:37,107 --> 02:09:39,027
Oh! no! I have used that one.

1756
02:09:39,067 --> 02:09:40,827
Do you have psoriasis
or something?

1757
02:09:40,867 --> 02:09:42,387
No...no... nothing like that.

1758
02:09:44,587 --> 02:09:46,867
Just dry these.

1759
02:10:33,147 --> 02:10:34,547
Ram, I have to
tell you something.

1760
02:10:34,587 --> 02:10:35,627
You have to listen.

1761
02:10:37,227 --> 02:10:38,507
You shouldn't stay like this.

1762
02:10:38,947 --> 02:10:40,187
You should get married.

1763
02:10:40,747 --> 02:10:42,387
You should have a
family of your own.

1764
02:10:43,627 --> 02:10:45,067
I want see your children.

1765
02:10:45,147 --> 02:10:46,467
I want to pet and pamper them.

1766
02:10:47,227 --> 02:10:49,267
I want to see if their
eyes have your semblance...

1767
02:10:49,307 --> 02:10:50,907
Whether their nose has
your semblance...

1768
02:10:50,947 --> 02:10:52,347
I want to see and enjoy all that.

1769
02:10:54,347 --> 02:10:55,587
I want to see your wife.

1770
02:10:56,707 --> 02:10:58,787
I want to know who your
wife is going to be.

1771
02:10:59,587 --> 02:11:00,867
I want to tell her something,

1772
02:11:01,787 --> 02:11:04,267
That no women will get
a gem of a guy like you!

1773
02:11:04,467 --> 02:11:06,707
So she better take great care of you.

1774
02:11:06,747 --> 02:11:08,587
I literally want to warn her.

1775
02:11:12,227 --> 02:11:13,467
I definitely will!

1776
02:11:28,187 --> 02:11:29,187
You want to eat?

1777
02:11:30,067 --> 02:11:31,307
Shall I order something?

1778
02:11:32,707 --> 02:11:34,467
Even in the hotel, you
did not eat anything.

1779
02:11:34,507 --> 02:11:35,507
Not hungry.

1780
02:11:37,907 --> 02:11:39,027
I am hungry.

1781
02:11:54,467 --> 02:11:55,507
Is it okay?

1782
02:11:58,147 --> 02:11:59,587
It's like my mother's cooking.

1783
02:12:11,867 --> 02:12:13,267
Janu, are you happy?

1784
02:12:13,707 --> 02:12:14,667
Hmm...

1785
02:12:15,267 --> 02:12:16,467
After many years.

1786
02:12:17,187 --> 02:12:18,267
Idiot!

1787
02:12:18,307 --> 02:12:19,347
I did not mean now.

1788
02:12:19,707 --> 02:12:21,867
I was asking, whether you're
generally happy in life?

1789
02:12:22,467 --> 02:12:24,707
What is this? You're asking me,
like my mother would.

1790
02:12:25,787 --> 02:12:27,067
I just felt like asking.

1791
02:12:27,107 --> 02:12:28,867
If you don't want to tell,
don't tell.

1792
02:12:33,947 --> 02:12:36,027
It was difficult
in the beginning.

1793
02:12:37,987 --> 02:12:40,147
I got caught alone in Singapore.

1794
02:12:40,587 --> 02:12:42,427
I won't know what to do,

1795
02:12:42,707 --> 02:12:44,947
every day I used to stand
in front of God and cry.

1796
02:12:46,427 --> 02:12:48,387
But he's a very nice person.

1797
02:12:48,707 --> 02:12:50,387
A very good father
to my daughter.

1798
02:12:51,667 --> 02:12:54,387
Without me saying much,
he understands me.

1799
02:12:55,987 --> 02:12:57,387
No problem as such.

1800
02:12:58,187 --> 02:13:00,107
If you're asking me
if I am happy...

1801
02:13:04,147 --> 02:13:05,867
I would say I am peaceful.

1802
02:13:11,707 --> 02:13:14,387
But, at this moment
I feel like saying something,

1803
02:13:15,027 --> 02:13:16,147
but I won't.

1804
02:13:26,827 --> 02:13:28,827
Janu, you don't get up.
Just stay there.

1805
02:13:29,187 --> 02:13:30,547
You may stumble upon something.

1806
02:13:30,587 --> 02:13:32,187
Just stay there.
I will just come now.

1807
02:13:40,307 --> 02:13:44,307
"On the banks of the river Yamuna,
as the cool breeze blows..."

1808
02:13:44,387 --> 02:13:48,147
"I dance with Lord Kannan..."

1809
02:13:48,307 --> 02:13:51,987
"The eyes blossom, looking at the path..."

1810
02:13:52,067 --> 02:13:55,907
"Young Radha wilts."

1811
02:13:55,987 --> 02:13:59,707
"The night has gone by,
the day has gone by..."

1812
02:13:59,747 --> 02:14:03,307
"The King is not with me."

1813
02:14:03,347 --> 02:14:07,227
"The young girl's
unblinking eyes..."

1814
02:14:07,267 --> 02:14:11,067
"Search, here and there..."

1815
02:14:11,227 --> 02:14:17,507
"Lord Kannan is not to be seen
in the cow herding grounds ."

1816
02:14:18,867 --> 02:14:24,987
"Falling in love,
is a painful joy."

1817
02:14:26,587 --> 02:14:30,427
"Lord Kannan is not to be seen
in the cow herding grounds ."

1818
02:14:30,507 --> 02:14:34,307
"Falling in love , is a painful joy."

1819
02:14:34,347 --> 02:14:38,547
"Poor Radha!"

1820
02:14:54,267 --> 02:14:55,227
What's all this?

1821
02:14:55,347 --> 02:14:56,307
Memories!

1822
02:14:57,587 --> 02:14:59,307
Wow! That old aroma!

1823
02:15:00,187 --> 02:15:02,907
How come you have, kept all
this safely, for so long?

1824
02:15:21,467 --> 02:15:22,387
Your's.

1825
02:15:22,987 --> 02:15:23,947
Mine?

1826
02:15:25,387 --> 02:15:27,227
How did this come to you?

1827
02:15:27,267 --> 02:15:29,347
Yeah, it grew legs and came!

1828
02:15:29,587 --> 02:15:32,027
I flicked it.
So I can keep it as memory of you.

1829
02:15:32,467 --> 02:15:33,547
But how?

1830
02:15:33,907 --> 02:15:37,547
You would leave your shawl in class,
when you go for the P.T period.

1831
02:15:37,587 --> 02:15:39,907
So, I kept following, planned it...

1832
02:15:40,107 --> 02:15:41,307
and one day, flicked it.

1833
02:15:51,907 --> 02:15:52,907
This is what I got.

1834
02:15:52,987 --> 02:15:55,507
Careful...careful...careful...

1835
02:16:02,387 --> 02:16:03,547
Hey!

1836
02:16:03,627 --> 02:16:05,827
- Nothing...nothing...nothing...
- Then why you snatching it?

1837
02:16:05,867 --> 02:16:06,947
Love letter is it?

1838
02:16:06,987 --> 02:16:07,707
No.

1839
02:16:08,147 --> 02:16:10,347
Are you kidding me!
Poetry is it?

1840
02:16:10,987 --> 02:16:12,267
About me, is it?

1841
02:16:13,547 --> 02:16:14,587
Give it to me.

1842
02:16:14,947 --> 02:16:15,907
No, Janu...

1843
02:16:16,027 --> 02:16:18,187
If you read it,
you will start laughing.

1844
02:16:18,267 --> 02:16:19,587
I am feeling shy.

1845
02:16:20,307 --> 02:16:21,467
Hey! hey!

1846
02:16:21,507 --> 02:16:23,587
Who is going to write
poetry about me?

1847
02:16:23,627 --> 02:16:25,027
Only you will write about me.

1848
02:16:25,427 --> 02:16:26,627
Okay! You read it yourself.

1849
02:16:27,667 --> 02:16:28,387
Read.

1850
02:16:36,427 --> 02:16:39,787
Girl, are you a sea full of waves?

1851
02:16:40,147 --> 02:16:42,347
My heart yearns, for your next wave!

1852
02:16:43,587 --> 02:16:46,907
Does a fish basket and a flower
shop require an advertisement?

1853
02:16:47,067 --> 02:16:49,947
Is an attendance register
required to know your arrival?

1854
02:16:50,467 --> 02:16:53,107
Apparently we will lose our
eyesight if we see the lightening.

1855
02:16:53,627 --> 02:16:56,507
We lose our eyesight
if we see the lightening.

1856
02:16:56,587 --> 02:17:00,027
But when I see your eyes
lightning enters me!

1857
02:17:00,387 --> 02:17:04,147
But when I see your eyes
lightning enters me!

1858
02:17:04,347 --> 02:17:07,347
If you belong to your mother who
carried you for ten months...

1859
02:17:07,627 --> 02:17:10,627
If you belong to your mother who
carried you for ten months...

1860
02:17:10,907 --> 02:17:14,547
Then you also belong to me, for I have
carried you in my heart for ages!

1861
02:18:28,827 --> 02:18:29,907
Ram!

1862
02:18:33,107 --> 02:18:34,307
Haven't you slept?

1863
02:18:37,347 --> 02:18:38,427
Okay, come up.

1864
02:18:42,147 --> 02:18:42,987
Up?

1865
02:18:43,227 --> 02:18:44,787
No I always sleep on the floor.
I am comfortable...

1866
02:18:44,827 --> 02:18:46,067
Just come up.

1867
02:19:43,846 --> 02:19:44,646
Hey!

1868
02:19:45,126 --> 02:19:46,286
Tell me your email id...

1869
02:19:46,326 --> 02:19:47,966
your height, weight...etc

1870
02:19:48,126 --> 02:19:48,886
Why?

1871
02:19:49,326 --> 02:19:51,646
- Let's fix a girl, for you today.
- No, don't want.

1872
02:19:51,886 --> 02:19:52,846
Why not?

1873
02:19:53,566 --> 02:19:54,446
Look here,

1874
02:19:54,846 --> 02:19:56,726
after being in love with
a girl like S.Janaki,

1875
02:19:56,766 --> 02:19:58,086
I can't marry any other girl.

1876
02:19:58,166 --> 02:20:01,606
Why not? I was also in
love with K.Ramachandran,

1877
02:20:01,646 --> 02:20:03,206
and did I not marry M.Saravanan.

1878
02:20:03,366 --> 02:20:04,846
Everything is possible.
Tell me.

1879
02:20:06,686 --> 02:20:09,046
Postbox78@gmail.com

1880
02:20:13,846 --> 02:20:14,806
Is it time?

1881
02:20:15,246 --> 02:20:16,406
Another 15 minutes to go.

1882
02:20:20,486 --> 02:20:23,846
That girl told me something
at the restaurant.

1883
02:20:24,046 --> 02:20:25,366
Yes, even I wanted to ask you.

1884
02:20:25,606 --> 02:20:27,486
She was whispering
into your ears.

1885
02:20:27,686 --> 02:20:28,486
What is it?

1886
02:20:29,126 --> 02:20:30,766
She said, sir is a very nice person,

1887
02:20:31,006 --> 02:20:32,926
and to take care of him well.

1888
02:20:35,086 --> 02:20:37,086
I know very well that
sir's a nice person.

1889
02:20:38,046 --> 02:20:39,806
But, she told me to
take care of him well.

1890
02:20:41,326 --> 02:20:43,166
I don't know what
to do for that.

1891
02:20:48,246 --> 02:20:49,486
Shall we leave?

1892
02:21:27,126 --> 02:21:29,646
"The night, like an island..."

1893
02:21:29,686 --> 02:21:32,766
"Is circling us..."

1894
02:21:32,966 --> 02:21:37,806
"Even the break of dawn
seems like darkness..."

1895
02:21:38,726 --> 02:21:44,086
"Memories like fire
are burning inside..."

1896
02:21:44,446 --> 02:21:49,286
"The body cries, like it is death!"

1897
02:21:49,766 --> 02:21:55,206
"Separation is my bond and I melt in it!"

1898
02:21:55,446 --> 02:22:01,286
"I am separating from what
breathes life into me!"

1899
02:22:01,646 --> 02:22:04,206
"Like the rivers that
flow from the mountains,"

1900
02:22:04,286 --> 02:22:07,126
"You flowed into my heart!"

1901
02:22:07,406 --> 02:22:09,326
"In the barren land..."

1902
02:22:09,366 --> 02:22:12,566
"You gave birth to a million seas!"

1903
02:22:12,806 --> 02:22:18,486
"Let the dream be my only companion!"

1904
02:22:20,486 --> 02:22:22,766
"The night, like an island..."

1905
02:22:22,806 --> 02:22:25,726
"Is circling us..."

1906
02:22:26,326 --> 02:22:30,726
"Even the break of dawn
seems like darkness..."

1907
02:23:06,246 --> 02:23:12,006
"This lotus, in spite of being
in the pond , is lonely."

1908
02:23:12,046 --> 02:23:17,766
"The sun basks in the warmth
even when it's not day."

1909
02:23:17,846 --> 02:23:23,486
"In one path...two souls are
searching for their soul mates..."

1910
02:23:23,566 --> 02:23:29,006
"Time is again and again
placing obstacles!"

1911
02:23:29,046 --> 02:23:34,366
"Living a life without you,
is that a life at all!"

1912
02:23:34,406 --> 02:23:40,526
"Come my life! Life is to live!
you are the life within me...!"

1913
02:23:40,566 --> 02:23:45,006
"Shall I come! Shall I come!"

1914
02:23:56,726 --> 02:23:57,726
Thank you Ma'am

1915
02:24:06,606 --> 02:24:08,206
Hope you have a pleasant stay

1916
02:24:13,206 --> 02:24:16,126
"Every single day my
heart comes alive..."

1917
02:24:16,166 --> 02:24:18,966
"And dies that very day!"

1918
02:24:19,006 --> 02:24:21,606
"Till the end of my life..."

1919
02:24:21,646 --> 02:24:24,646
"My heart will celebrate you!"

1920
02:24:24,726 --> 02:24:27,806
"Even when trees fall
and nests shatter..."

1921
02:24:27,846 --> 02:24:30,646
"Birds still sing
their melody!"

1922
02:24:30,726 --> 02:24:33,446
"Even when the night is over
And almost done with..."

1923
02:24:33,486 --> 02:24:36,166
"The moon still waits patiently!"

1924
02:24:36,206 --> 02:24:39,046
"The rain drops reach the sea!"

1925
02:24:39,086 --> 02:24:41,926
"The immortal love will reach Earth!"

1926
02:24:41,966 --> 02:24:44,606
"Even when by body is away from you..."

1927
02:24:44,686 --> 02:24:48,806
"My love will live with you forever!"

1928
02:24:48,846 --> 02:24:54,446
"You take leave..."

1929
02:25:38,206 --> 02:25:39,126
What?

1930
02:25:40,286 --> 02:25:42,366
Let, me stay with you for
a little more time.

1931
02:25:42,966 --> 02:25:44,526
It's already late, Janu.

1932
02:25:44,966 --> 02:25:46,046
Please, Ram

1933
02:26:01,966 --> 02:26:03,326
Don't look like that.

1934
02:26:12,526 --> 02:26:13,406
Okay, hold this.

1935
02:26:13,446 --> 02:26:14,526
Where you going?

1936
02:26:15,006 --> 02:26:16,646
Okay, wait, will
come and tell you.

1937
02:26:31,046 --> 02:26:33,726
I've taken a ticket for myself
on the same flight as yours.

1938
02:26:33,886 --> 02:26:35,686
Till you board the flight
I will be with you.

1939
02:26:35,766 --> 02:26:36,726
Okay.

1940
02:26:47,446 --> 02:26:48,886
If you cry for this...

1941
02:26:50,006 --> 02:26:50,966
Wipe your tears.

1942
02:26:51,406 --> 02:26:52,246
Walk.

1943
02:26:58,926 --> 02:26:59,806
Show me.

1944
02:27:02,446 --> 02:27:03,206
Your id?
