1
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
{\an8}Oh.

2
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,520
{\an8}Do you work here?

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,440
{\an8}- Um, I'm a visitor.
- Right.

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,200
{\an8}Right. Do you wanna
just come through for a second?

5
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:05,160
{\an8}Sorry. I'm a bit late.

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,040
{\an8}That's all right.
I saw you coming up on the cameras.

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,560
{\an8}He's being brought down.

8
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,762
{\an8}Um, I heard he was
involved in a violent incident.

9
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:17,240
{\an8}-How'd you hear that?
-It was reported up.

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,320
{\an8}- That would be useful to see--
- Is that… relevant?

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,960
{\an8}To what you'll assess?

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,480
{\an8}I'd like to see it.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,440
{\an8}Okay. I'll, uh, fire up the megaport.

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Yeah, he's been pretty quiet.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,480
Don't know if that's relevant.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,640
If what I think and observe
is relevant to what you assess.

17
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:50,520
Here we go.

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,000
-Yeah. It's just bruising and scratching.
-I read the report.

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,560
-Both blame the other.
-I know. I read the report.

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,040
You're on… five visits?

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,080
-Yes.
-Mm.

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,960
Know what you're gonna say in the report?

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,360
I wouldn't be here if I knew that.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,080
Well, the other one of you.
He only needed three, so--

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,400
You can't say any more.

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,240
It's important I don't know
what the other psychologist says,

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,720
does, or thinks.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,472
It's about making the <i>right </i>assessment,
not the fastest.

29
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:35,640
-Sorry. I'm just being an idiot.
-No, I did… That's just the way I work.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,520
Right. That's Jamie in place.

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,760
I'll take you through.

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,280
I need to get a hot chocolate
from the machine.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
I remember.

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,480
Get off me!

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,520
No! You get off!

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
Yeah, we've got a torture lab
in the basement.

37
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,440
Government approved. All very hush-hush.

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,040
What are they?

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,440
He likes his hot chocolate
with marshmallows on.

40
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,100
You must mean business.
Never done them before.

41
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,480
That was, uh, Mark, I think.

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,560
Radiator burns all over him, poor kid.

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,040
I don't know what he did
to get here, though.

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,240
He's not famous like your Jamie.

45
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,520
- Come on!
- Two of us on the way now.

46
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
Right. You know where I am.

47
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,680
-You okay?
-Yes.

48
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,240
-Hi, Jamie.
-Hi.

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,240
-You need us, we're here.
-Yes.

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,160
-Same goes for you, Jamie.
-Yeah.

51
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,920
We'll be watching, okay?

52
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,200
Hot chocolate.

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Spri… Sprinkles?

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,920
Lots of them.

55
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
You remembered. Thank you.

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,960
And I saved you half my sandwich
in case you were hungry.

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
What is it?

58
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:48,000
Cheese and pickle.

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,299
No tomatoes?

60
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,600
Tomatoes don't go very well
with pickle.

61
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
No salad?

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,480
Would I do that to you?

63
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,600
There's no tomatoes. No salad.
There's just cheese and pickle.

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,120
- Do you want it? I'll save it for later.
- No. I'll have it.

65
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,920
Ah, I… I don't know about pickle,
though, but… I'll have it.

66
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,560
- Did you make it?
- Yes.

67
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,520
- You make butties, do you?
- What, you think that's weird?

68
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,440
No. My mum makes 'em.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,320
Well, that makes two of us, then.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,960
This is nice.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,960
It's a bit hot.

72
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,760
I don't mind hot.

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,120
- You're looking better than last time.
- What's that supposed to mean?

74
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,600
You've just got some of your color back.

75
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,040
-You sound like a granny.
-Do I?

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,720
"Oh, you got your color back.
You can't have been that ill."

77
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
-That's a good voice.
-No.

78
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
Do you see
your grandparents much?

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
-Well, not recently, no.
-No, I meant before all this.

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
Yeah, a bit.

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,880
My dad's side… my dad's mum and dad.
My mum didn't get on with hers.

82
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,680
Yeah, we spoke about that.

83
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,411
So, what are your dad's parents like?

84
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:13,040
I don't know. Like him.

85
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,960
Well, what does that mean?

86
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,320
They like things as they like them.
"No gravy. Such a shame."

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,972
Or, "I like a slice with my dinner
if you've got one in, Amanda."

88
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:26,320
A slice… A slice of what?

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,000
Bread.

90
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,520
- You're posh, aren't ya?
- No, I'm just not from where you're from.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,120
Well, what do you call bread
if you don't call it a slice?

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,480
Mm, bread?

93
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,000
You're posh.

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,440
If it makes you happy that I am,
Jamie, then I am.

95
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Well, what do you call your grandad?
Bet you call him "Grandpa."

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,080
- I do not.
- I bet you do.

97
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,600
I call him "Pop-pop."

98
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
What?

99
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Do ya?

100
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,120
-Yes, I do.
-Wow!

101
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,480
- Jesus. I've not heard that one before.
- I don't know why.

102
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,600
Okay. Maybe he asked me
to call him that. I'm not sure.

103
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,983
God, you're really posh.

104
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
Are you not gonna try the sandwich?

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
I'll have it later. It's just… the pickle.

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Hate it.

107
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,600
You hate it?

108
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,400
- Oh, I really messed up, then.
- Yeah, you did.

109
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay.

110
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
So, can we talk a bit about you?

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,520
You see a lot of your dad
in your grandad, do you?

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,520
Yeah, I don't know.

113
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,320
Is it just what they say,
or how they do things?

114
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,360
What's your dad and his dad like?

115
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Men.

116
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,240
Okay. Well, would "masculine"
be an okay word to use?

117
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:41,160
<i>You </i>used it.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
When I hear the word "masculine,"
I think they can mend things.

119
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,840
They like to make things.

120
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,240
They like sports.
They like going to the pub.

121
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,759
Yeah.

122
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
Not the pub, but, yeah.

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Your dad doesn't go to the pub?

124
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:00,700
No, not… not really.

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,640
Not as much as my pop-pop.

126
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,796
- Not gonna let me forget that, are you?
- No.

127
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,800
So, your grandad's
more of a pub man, is he?

128
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:14,320
I dunno. He…
He's not around that much anymore.

129
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,280
How much?

130
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,120
Every other Sunday, maybe.

131
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,560
Sometimes in the week when they're both…

132
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,000
Mum and Dad are both working,
but that's more Granny.

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
A bit more in the holidays.

134
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,680
- We went to Tenerife with them once.
- On holiday?

135
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,440
No, banana picking.

136
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,011
-Obviously it was on holiday.
-Okay.

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,960
I don't think I've ever heard anyone
use banana picking in a comeback.

138
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,080
I suppose the other thing I think about
when I hear the word "masculine"

139
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,840
would be the way that masculine men--

140
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,200
This started 'cause I said
you sounded like a granny.

141
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,980
What?

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,320
This all started
because I said you sounded like a granny.

143
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,600
And now you're just going on
about masculine stuff.

144
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,760
Yes.

145
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,240
The first time you came,
you had actual questions.

146
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,200
"Is this right, Jamie?
Do you know whether this is wrong, Jamie?"

147
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,680
- Now you're just chatting shit.
- I hope I'm not.

148
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,200
Well, you are,
because the first time you're all,

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,400
"If an adult guinea pig eats
one of its kids, is that normal or weird?"

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
- And now you're, "What do you call bread?"
- Come on.

151
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,280
- I'm interested.
- It feels like a trick.

152
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,280
Trick? Trick into what?

153
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,160
My dad's okay.

154
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
All right?

155
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,920
Okay. I know.

156
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,960
Just talking about him.

157
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
There isn't a need.

158
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
Fine, if that's how you feel.
But I'm not trying to trick you.

159
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,336
-And now I've pissed you off.
-No.

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,560
Can I see your notes?
What you've got written down about me?

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,680
-Do you see me writing?
-You must write stuff.

162
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,960
Yes.

163
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,720
Can I see what you wrote?
What you've written?

164
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,440
Of course you can't.

165
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,480
- The lawyers have said you work for us.
- That's not what they say, Jamie.

166
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
And I know that because I asked them
the last time you said that to me.

167
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,200
You talk to them?

168
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,600
I explained. I've been employed
by your team, but I don't work for you.

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,323
-What do you tell them?
-I'm writing an independent--

170
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:23,760
-What do they say to you?
-A presentence offense report.

171
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,800
Which the judge will read
to get an understanding of you

172
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,280
and your understanding
of the charges. Okay?

173
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,920
All I want to do is talk to you, Jamie,
and have you talk to me.

174
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,116
Yes, I've asked
some straightforward questions.

175
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:41,045
But I think…

176
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:42,640
Am I boring you?

177
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,729
-No.
-Okay.

178
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,120
I think you,
and everyone else for that matter,

179
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,320
are far more complex
than straightforward questions allow for.

180
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,520
We had a good conversation last time.
Can we try that again?

181
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,640
What did we talk about last time?

182
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,520
We spoke about your friends,
your sister, your mum. We went--

183
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,960
- Can't remember saying anything about 'em.
- Well, you did.

184
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
How you feel about them. How Lisa's doing.
What you think your mum thinks of you.

185
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,800
- Now you wanna talk about my dad?
- I want to talk about lots of things.

186
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,520
I could tell you questions that
I wrote down to talk to you about today.

187
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,760
If that helps.

188
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,040
All right. Yeah.

189
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,720
Okay. Well, I wanted
to talk about the fight you had.

190
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,640
- That was nothing.
- I was interested why you got in a fight.

191
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,680
- He hit me first.
- Why?

192
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,960
Because we've had beef over stuff.

193
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,280
It doesn't matter.
It wasn't a proper fight.

194
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
- It's not that interesting?
- It's not.

195
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,400
Okay, let's move on.

196
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,240
- What? I'm in charge now, am I?
- Mm. Maybe.

197
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,960
I also wrote down that I wanted to talk
to you about what being a man feels like.

198
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,840
You want a cock and balls, do ya?

199
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm interested in what being a man
feels like for you.

200
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,440
I dunno.

201
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,800
It's too big a question, right?

202
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,280
And the fight's too small a question.

203
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,160
Which is why it's more useful
for me to see where the conversation goes

204
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,440
and steer it a bit into what you think of
your dad and your grandad, for instance.

205
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,160
The type of men you think they are.

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,080
Rather than saying, "So, Jamie,
what do you think being a man feels like?"

207
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,480
"So, Jamie, what do you think
being a man feels like?"

208
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,840
It's not a trick.

209
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,600
It's just a conversation.

210
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,320
So, do you think it would be okay
if we speak about your dad?

211
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,760
Can I just see your notes?
What you wrote, how you wrote it?

212
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
Nope.

213
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,840
You're not that in charge.

214
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,480
Does your dad like his job?

215
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,520
He fixes toilets. What do you think?

216
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,240
He works hard.

217
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Long hours. You get the best money
from emergency plumbing out of hours.

218
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Is he funny?

219
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,400
Sometimes.

220
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,360
Loving?

221
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
- No, that's weird.
- Angry?

222
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,880
I suppose.

223
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,320
How angry does he get?

224
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,000
He's never hit me.

225
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,400
Okay, go on.

226
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
Go on what?

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,560
- Is that what this is about?
- Why do you call him angry?

228
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,120
He just gets mad. We all do.

229
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,800
Okay. That's okay.
He's just angry in a normal way.

230
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,160
Well, he's pulled a shed down once
when he was in a proper rager, but…

231
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:37,880
…that's as bad as it gets.

232
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,240
Were you frightened?

233
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,760
No, I… I thought it was quite funny
at the time.

234
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,520
Lisa did too. Then Mum sent us upstairs.

235
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
He's not like that most of the time.

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,120
Hardly ever.

237
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,320
What does he do when he's not working?

238
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
It just feels like you're testing him.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
No, I'm just interested
in your view of him.

240
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,240
He's a big presence in your life.
He was your appropriate adult.

241
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah, 'cause… he doesn't judge.

242
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,360
He… He's a kind person.

243
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,120
That's good to know.

244
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,600
So, what does he do when he's not working?

245
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,960
He basically likes all sport.

246
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,040
My mum always said if he'd watch
lawn bowls, he'd make it fun.

247
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,000
Would you watch lawn bowls with him?

248
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,120
No, it's… it's not for me.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,440
Are you not into sport?

250
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,480
- No.
- None of it?

251
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,480
Yeah, I'm… I'm not good at much,
but… I'm really good at getting out of PE.

252
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,320
How do you do that, then?

253
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,480
Um, headaches. Hurt my leg.

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,920
Funny tummy.

255
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:51,000
"Sir, I feel dizzy.
Can I sit down?" That sort of thing.

256
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,160
What did… does your dad make of that?

257
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,240
He, um… He didn't…

258
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,080
He doesn't…
He doesn't know.

259
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,160
He knew I wasn't sporty
or anything like that.

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,680
I… I used to, uh…
He used to take me to football.

261
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:12,846
This…

262
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,160
This football thing on… on Saturdays.

263
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
And he'd, um…

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,080
He'd cheer me on and everything, but…

265
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
But when I… I'd fuck up, he'd just…

266
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,560
He'd… He'd just look away.

267
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:53,480
Pretend he didn't see?

268
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,800
Maybe, or…

269
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:04,539
Maybe he just didn't want me
to see him looking…

270
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,640
…sorry.

271
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
Sorry?

272
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,360
I dunno.

273
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,560
Ashamed.

274
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,280
How did you feel when you saw that shame?

275
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,760
- You're supposed to say he wasn't.
- Am I?

276
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Yeah.

277
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,560
You're supposed to say,
"Oh, bet he wasn't ashamed."

278
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,120
"Bet you just thought that, Jamie."

279
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Or, "Is that what you really think?
He wouldn't be ashamed, not of his kid."

280
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,240
- Have other people said that to you?
- It's just the right thing to say.

281
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
Isn't it lying?

282
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
No.

283
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:42,240
I don't know. I don't like lying.

284
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,640
I wasn't into school sports either.

285
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,240
Yeah, well, you were good
at other stuff, though, weren't ya?

286
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,040
Why do you think that?

287
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,400
You look like you were, and you're…

288
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,120
And you're clever, so…

289
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,280
Did you not think
you were very good at anything else?

290
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,320
No. I… I didn't care I wasn't.

291
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
It must be hard to feel that way.

292
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,600
No.

293
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,560
I think most people think like that.

294
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Most people think
they're bad at everything?

295
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,520
Most people are.

296
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
Does your sister feel like that?

297
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,440
No.

298
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,120
Lisa's clever.

299
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,800
Your dad?

300
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,680
I don't know.

301
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
My… My mum does, though.

302
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,800
Your mum thinks she's bad at everything?

303
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,520
She can cook a roast, but…

304
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,720
I mean, you'd have to ask her.

305
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Have you met them yet?

306
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,280
- Your family?
- Yeah.

307
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,480
I've… spoken to your dad on the phone.

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,040
- Yeah?
- Yes. As part of my assessment.

309
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,240
How is he?

310
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,360
He's okay. He's sad you're here.
I can't say more than that.

311
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,600
Well, it… it's wrong…

312
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
…that I'm in here.

313
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,240
Can I ask you a question?

314
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960
Of course you can.

315
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,640
- Can you get me out of this place?
- I'm afraid I'm of no use to you there.

316
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
Why couldn't they
put me in a proper prison?

317
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,920
- A better facility wasn't available.
- Putting me in a madhouse?

318
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,440
- It's a secure training center.
- Training?

319
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,120
What are they training us for?

320
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,160
The other boys just scream all the time.

321
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,000
They rock backwards and forwards,
and they shout at Coronation Street.

322
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,600
All the way through Corrie.

323
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,080
One kid goes nuts every time
he sees Steve McDonald. It's mad in here.

324
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,558
-This was the best place for you.
-Ryan gets to stay home until his trial.

325
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,560
Ryan isn't accused
of such a serious crime.

326
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,280
<i>Accused</i>. It's all accused.

327
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,320
If I did it, if I hurt her,
then I'd get it, but I didn't, so--

328
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,080
-As far as I understand it--
-Am I getting moved for the trial?

329
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
Nothing has been decided yet.

330
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you know where it's gonna be?
London or local?

331
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,160
You need to sit down, Jamie.
If you don't sit down, I have--

332
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,320
You don't know, or you just won't tell me?

333
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,720
Nothing's been decided yet.
You need to sit down!

334
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,640
I don't want to sit!

335
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,760
If you don't sit,
I have to stop this discussion.

336
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,720
- Maybe I want you to!
- Do you?

337
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,920
It'd piss you off. You'd have to go home
and then come back again.

338
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Jamie, if you do not sit--

339
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't fucking wanna sit down!

340
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,120
You do not tell me when to sit down!

341
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
You do not control what I fucking…

342
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,880
Look at me now!

343
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,840
You do not control what I do in my life!

344
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,040
Get that
in that fucking little head of yours!

345
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,560
Fucking hell!

346
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
Is everything okay?

347
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,200
- There isn't a problem.
- Fuck.

348
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,840
Jamie.

349
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,520
I shouted. I'm sorry.

350
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,840
- Do you want him taken out?
- No.

351
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,440
I'll get a cup of tea,
though, if that's okay.

352
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,080
Can I have another hot chocolate, please?

353
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,160
-Sure.
-You don't have to.

354
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,200
Sure.

355
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,306
Causing trouble, is he?

356
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,880
Uh, could I look in the room?

357
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
- There's no audio.
- That's fine. Can I look?

358
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,760
Of course. <i>Mi casa </i>is your <i>casa</i>.
Or whatever they say.

359
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,080
- After you.
- Thank you.

360
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,120
What are you seeing?

361
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,120
I mean, what is it you're looking for?
Is it body language stuff?

362
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,800
It's just, I'm reading a book
on that at the moment.

363
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,680
My sister gave it to me.

364
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,120
You see,

365
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,840
people hide.

366
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,160
I know I don't need to tell you this,
but… they hide so much.

367
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,160
Maybe they tell the truth
with their bodies, hm?

368
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,320
-Faces--
-Yes, maybe.

369
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,680
I couldn't do what you do.

370
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,080
I'm sure I couldn't do what you do.

371
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,080
Do you want to job swap?

372
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,920
What's your hours?

373
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,633
What's your wages?

374
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,440
- What's your holiday allowance?
- No. I like my job most of the time.

375
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,520
Well… I hate mine.

376
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So you're probably best off.

377
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,360
Right.

378
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,280
That's all I needed.

379
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,640
Dib dib dib.

380
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,200
- Pleased to help.
- Thank you.

381
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,080
Thanks.

382
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,880
Would you be comfortable
with me staying?

383
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,000
No, I wouldn't like that at all.

384
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,760
Right, Jamie. I'm not a police officer.
I'm not here to elicit a confession.

385
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm just here to understand.
I know you think I'm trying to trick you.

386
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,840
I said… I said that ages ago.

387
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,480
I am just here to get an understanding
of your understanding.

388
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,040
And I understand

389
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,000
that you need to have an understanding
of my understanding.

390
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,880
Go on.

391
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,960
Ask your questions.

392
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,598
I will be better now.

393
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
Okay. Uh…

394
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,840
Well, I suppose the other thing I think of
in relation to the word "masculinity"

395
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,000
would be how masculine men
feel about women.

396
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,600
- We're back on that, are we?
- Yes. Is that okay?

397
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:51,660
Yeah.

398
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,720
You need to have an understanding
of my understanding of women.

399
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
- I forgot your hot chocolate.
- It's fine.

400
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,280
- I'll get it.
- No, just… sit down, please.

401
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,760
It's fine. I don't deserve it.

402
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,960
I shouted.

403
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,680
Ask your questions
about men, women, whatever.

404
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,320
Well, you must have views
on men and women.

405
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,120
How does your dad treat your mum?

406
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,440
- Are you trying to get at my dad again?
- No, not get at him.

407
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,720
Dad's actually nice to Mum.

408
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,280
You did say he tore down a shed.

409
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Yeah, he just gets angry with himself,
but he's never hit her.

410
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,040
Does he speak to other women?

411
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,480
- What?
- Is he friendly with other women?

412
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,160
What? No. He loves my mum.

413
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,840
No, I'm asking
whether any of his friends are women.

414
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,440
No, his mates are his mates.

415
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,560
And they're men?

416
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,880
Is that wrong? What does that mean?

417
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,000
No. No, that's not wrong.

418
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,520
I thought we'd done talking about my dad.

419
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,160
- Jamie, I'm just trying to understand--
- Understand.

420
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,720
I know, but… none of this
is nothing to do with him.

421
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,600
Okay, that's fine.

422
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,680
- Do <i>you </i>have any mates who are women?
- No.

423
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,320
Like your dad, your mates are male?

424
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,480
The other shrink asks
more normal questions, you know?

425
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,080
- Okay.
- Wanna know what he asks?

426
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,320
-I can't know.
-I'm just saying.

427
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,280
I can't know, Jamie.
My conclusions have to be independent.

428
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,400
All right, okay. I won't say anything.

429
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
What do you think about women?

430
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
I like them.

431
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,480
But you're not, like you say,
particularly friends with them?

432
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm not a twat, though.

433
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,120
- Are you attracted to women?
- Yeah, I'm not gay.

434
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,280
We've established
you don't have a girlfriend.

435
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,600
- Yeah.
- But I don't think I asked before.

436
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,240
Would you <i>like </i>a girlfriend?

437
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
Yeah, who doesn't?

438
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,440
If you had a girlfriend,
what would you do with her?

439
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,960
What does that mean?

440
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,640
Well, would you take her out?
If you did, where would you take her?

441
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:55,866
The cinema.

442
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,520
To see what kind of film?

443
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
A horror.

444
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,800
Fifteen certificate?

445
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,160
Mm. Yeah, they're pretty slack.
You can get in.

446
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,880
And after the cinema, would you

447
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,840
take her for a walk,
take her straight home?

448
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,880
No.

449
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,880
Not straight home.

450
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,600
Would you want to kiss her?

451
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,600
- Are you allowed to ask these questions?
- What, you don't discuss this in PSHE?

452
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,680
What do you think is the normal amount

453
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,160
someone your age
would do sexually with a girl or boy?

454
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,280
- I told you, I'm not gay.
- I wasn't suggesting that you were.

455
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,240
- You really want me to answer?
- Yes, if you can.

456
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,320
I don't know. Touching. Kissing.

457
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,640
Well, what do you mean by touching?

458
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,640
Touching her… Touching her bits.

459
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,400
Her chest?

460
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,240
- Yeah.
- Her backside?

461
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,280
- Yeah.
- Her vulva?

462
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,200
Her vagina?

463
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,080
I don't know, maybe.

464
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,280
- Probably not?
- Maybe.

465
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,200
Are you sure
you're allowed to ask these questions?

466
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,560
So, you think it's normal
for a 13-year-old heterosexual boy

467
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,040
to have engaged in touching
of a girl's chest and her backside?

468
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,134
Above or below clothes?

469
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:21,560
Below… maybe.

470
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,200
Above, mostly.

471
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,360
I've actually done all that.
Kissing and touching.

472
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,360
Okay.

473
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,600
And I've had two girls
show me their tits. Chest.

474
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,800
It's okay. You don't
have to use my language.

475
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,040
And I touched them, so…

476
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,800
Okay.

477
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,120
And one of them touched my,
uh… my… my knob

478
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,920
through my trousers.

479
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,080
Okay.

480
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
And I think she liked it.

481
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
And you liked it?

482
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,200
Of course.

483
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,200
Not really.

484
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,560
You didn't like it?

485
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,720
I dunno.

486
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,720
There's no right or wrong answer
in this room, Jamie.

487
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,400
You do know that.
It's just your best attempt at the truth.

488
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah.

489
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,800
That… That didn't happen.

490
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,840
- You weren't touched on your trousers?
- No, I wasn't.

491
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,960
And did two girls go topless with you?

492
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,880
No, but…

493
00:28:40,071 --> 00:28:43,680
- I've seen photos, though.
- You've seen porn photos?

494
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
No, not porn.

495
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,920
Everyone sees porn.

496
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,560
Just these two girls in my year
that I knew. Well, know.

497
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,920
You saw photos
of two girls in your year topless?

498
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Yeah.

499
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,440
Would they be happy you saw those photos?

500
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,280
Everyone else did.

501
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,000
Was Katie one of those two girls?

502
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,560
What?

503
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,280
- How do you know that?
- How did it feel--

504
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,240
- No. How did you guess that?
- I didn't guess it. I asked it.

505
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,440
And now I'd like to know
what it felt like to see that.

506
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,680
- You're asking whether I got a hard-on?
- I'm asking how it felt.

507
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:31,000
I… I liked it.
Are we allowed to talk like this?

508
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,240
How does it make you feel,
looking at naked pictures of people?

509
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,160
How do you think?

510
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,680
How does it make you feel,

511
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,080
looking at naked pictures
of people you know?

512
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,760
I dunno. Good.

513
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,200
Powerful?

514
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,200
- Do you feel like it gives you a power?
- No.

515
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
It's just weird.

516
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,720
Were you attracted to Katie?

517
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,640
She wasn't my type.

518
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,560
So you weren't?

519
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,780
She was quite…

520
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,000
…no offense, but flat, you know?

521
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,440
Right.

522
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,600
Well, everyone else said it… who saw it.
That's not just me.

523
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,480
The picture got passed around the school.
Snapchat, you know.

524
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,284
It was just her…

525
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:18,919
…top half.

526
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,560
Not, uh, anything else.

527
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
She sent it to Fidget,
and then he sent it on.

528
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,600
Why did she send it to Fidget?

529
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,960
I dunno. She fancied him.

530
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,320
So she was trying to attract him?

531
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,000
I think he asked her.

532
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,600
He's not gonna get
any more pictures, though, is he?

533
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,840
No. She's dead.

534
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,080
No, I…

535
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,680
I didn't mean from her.

536
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,000
I meant from other girls.

537
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,280
No one'll send him pictures

538
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,962
because he wasn't careful
with the one he got.

539
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,320
The twat.

540
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,200
So you think he should have collected
more pictures from more girls

541
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,240
before he shared them with other boys?

542
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:07,871
Yeah. I dunno.

543
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,400
Why… Why did you say
"She's dead" like that?

544
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
Because she is.

545
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,640
Jamie, I asked
whether you were attracted to women.

546
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,800
Do you think women are attracted to you?

547
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,880
What sort of question's that?

548
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,280
Well, what do you think?
Do you think girls are attracted to you?

549
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,160
No.

550
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,840
Of course not.

551
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,120
Why, "of course not"?

552
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,720
Because I'm… I… I'm ugly.

553
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,840
How does that make you feel?

554
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,760
- Aren't you supposed to say I'm not ugly?
- What I think isn't important.

555
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,760
You don't say the things
normal people say.

556
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,480
How would you feel if I did?

557
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,720
I don't know why you don't say
things normal people say.

558
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,720
I should have contradicted you
when you said your dad was ashamed,

559
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,680
and you think I should contradict you now
when you tell me you think yourself ugly?

560
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,640
I dunno.

561
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,520
I'm interested in the fact
that you think you're ugly, Jamie.

562
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Yeah, I'm…

563
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,800
I'm fascinating.

564
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,920
I'm interested in it

565
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
because what you think is more important
to me than what is true, okay?

566
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,440
So, how do you feel about being ugly?

567
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,120
Well, how would you feel?

568
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,520
You don't know.

569
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,200
- You're not. You're dead pretty.
- This isn't about me, Jamie.

570
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,600
- You don't think you're pretty?
- I'm not the interesting person.

571
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,760
You don't think you're pretty?
You do think I'm ugly?

572
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,360
I haven't passed judgement on either
of those things. For very good reason.

573
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,600
- "For very good reason."
- I want to understand you.

574
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,400
To understand my understanding
of my understanding of my understanding.

575
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,320
Yes.

576
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,680
- The other bloke is much more easy.
- Okay.

577
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Him checking whether I understand
was much easier.

578
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,720
- Whether I understand what I did.
- They need two opinions for a reason.

579
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,120
Look, no, fuck off!
I didn't fucking say that!

580
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,920
You're fucking putting words in me mouth!

581
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,400
- It's a fucking trap in here! You are…
- Hey! Jamie!

582
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
What was that?

583
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,840
Hey?

584
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,920
What the fuck was that?

585
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,240
Signaling him away
like a fucking queen, yeah?

586
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,320
I need you to sit down.

587
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,360
Fuck.

588
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:22,357
Fuck.

589
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,280
Fuck.

590
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,760
Fuck's sake.

591
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,520
- Are you going to sit down?
- Fuck off!

592
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,920
For fuck's sake.

593
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,880
Fuck. Fuck.

594
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,720
Are you done?

595
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,280
Fine.

596
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,320
I will fucking sit down.

597
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,680
You happy now?

598
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,440
Hey?

599
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,760
Well, are you going now?

600
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,960
Are you going?

601
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,400
Would you like me to?

602
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,320
It's not up to me, is it?

603
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,760
If you want me to go, Jamie, I can go.

604
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,640
You said in one of our previous sessions
that you had friends, Tommy and Ryan.

605
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,560
But that you wouldn't
consider yourself popular.

606
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:10,020
Yeah.

607
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,320
You said you were bullied.
The three of you were bullied.

608
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,960
People like you
love talking about bullying.

609
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,840
You said Tommy was called Round Pounds

610
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,280
because his mum
did her shopping at Poundland.

611
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,760
Yeah, but she doesn't.

612
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,320
And Ryan was called dumb.

613
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,640
Ryan <i>is </i>dumb.

614
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,760
That one was sort of true.

615
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,800
- The three of you felt ostracized.
- Big words coming out now.

616
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,000
You said sometimes
this would get physical.

617
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,280
People would spit on you
from classroom windows.

618
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,160
You'd be tripped up and pushed.

619
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:41,815
Yeah.

620
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:46,640
- You were called names, physically abused.
- No. I was just tripped up and spat on.

621
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,520
My question, Jamie, is
why do you have an Instagram account?

622
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,880
What?

623
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,160
- I… I need one.
- Why?

624
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
To look at other people's accounts.

625
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,080
You can't if you haven't got one.

626
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,280
Right. And you follow lots of women
on Instagram. Models.

627
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,920
Yeah.

628
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,400
You don't need to put photos up, though.
Why do you?

629
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,520
Put photos up of yourself, I mean?

630
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,520
I dunno. Am I not allowed?

631
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,200
Yeah.

632
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,560
Is it to prove bullies wrong by showing
the fun you have with Tommy and Ryan?

633
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,560
What? No.

634
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,560
To show the fun you have with your family?

635
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,560
No way I'm putting anything up of them.

636
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,800
If you've seen that,
it's because my sister tagged me.

637
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,600
Because you think
someone might like one of your photos?

638
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,640
You might get into a conversation,
make a new friend, meet a girl?

639
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,680
What? No. What you on about?

640
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,440
Katie commented on your photos
on a number of different occasions.

641
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,560
Uh, yeah.

642
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:56,200
What are you doing?

643
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,040
- What… What's this?
- Budge up.

644
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,800
She wrote this.

645
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,360
No. Are… Are you allowed
to ask these questions?

646
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,880
- Has Dillon passed these questions fit?
- Yes.

647
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,000
He has. I'm allowed
to ask about intimacies, Jamie.

648
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,120
But if this makes you uncomfortable
or you have any questions,

649
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,360
there are people in this facility
that can help you. Okay?

650
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,680
Katie wrote this on your Facebook feed.

651
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,680
Facebook?

652
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
Instagram.

653
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,080
Are you all right?

654
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,280
You look a bit red.

655
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
Did I scare you when I shouted?

656
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,280
- She wrote this on your Instagram.
- I mean, I'm only 13.

657
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,800
I don't think I look that scary.

658
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,760
- Could you tell me what these emojis are?
- How embarrassing is that?

659
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,760
Getting scared of a 13-year-old.

660
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,280
Wow.

661
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,560
What do these emojis mean, Jamie?

662
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,880
What do the kidney beans mean?
They're kidney beans, right?

663
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,560
She's pretending like I'm part
of one of those truth groups.

664
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,720
What truth groups?

665
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,800
The ones that say
that women don't want us and don't care.

666
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,240
- Are you part of those?
- No.

667
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,800
But you know what they say?

668
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,440
Yeah, 'cause everyone
kept on going on about it.

669
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,400
Incel stuff. So I had a look,
but I didn't like it.

670
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,960
And was you being an incel
what she was saying with all of these?

671
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,920
Yeah.

672
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,240
Could you explain them all?

673
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,040
Uh… want love, won't get it.

674
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
My throat's killing.

675
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,400
Uh, red pill, exploding.

676
00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:21,607
That's the same as the red pill.

677
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,480
And then that's an 80-20 thing.

678
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,000
What's an 80-20 thing?

679
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Where 80% of women
are attracted to 20% of men.

680
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:37,557
But I do think
they're right about that, though.

681
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,480
And lots of people
liked her comments quite a lot.

682
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,600
Yeah, they thought it was funny.

683
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,080
You must have found that quite cruel.

684
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,520
I suppose.

685
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,480
Did she do this to anyone else?

686
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,200
- No.
- Well, why did she do it to you?

687
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,840
Because… Because I'm ugly.

688
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,720
- You think that's why she did it to you?
- Well, I'm the ugliest, I suppose, so…

689
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,840
Did you ever call her on it?

690
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,960
- Yeah.
- What did you say?

691
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,240
I don't know.
"I'm not what you say I am," or…

692
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,640
And what did she say?

693
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,520
She just…

694
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,320
She just smiled and said, "Okay,"
and walked away.

695
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,480
And you never thought to tell anyone?

696
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,160
- It's a bit late for that now.
- That just must have hurt.

697
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,320
I didn't kill her.

698
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,360
You think I did because you've seen
the video. You can't trust videos anymore.

699
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,600
It's all fake news.

700
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,760
- I'm not here to judge.
- I didn't kill her.

701
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,560
She was a bitch. Even you can see that.

702
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,680
I should've killed her,
but I didn't. I just…

703
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,720
All… All I did…

704
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,480
All I did was…

705
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,600
Look at ya.

706
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,280
All hopeful, like I'm gonna say
something important.

707
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,560
All I did…

708
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,000
I did ask her out… after the photo.

709
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,360
I went round and said I was sorry
that they'd done that to her.

710
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,080
Showing everyone her tits. Her chest.

711
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,040
And I wanted to know
if she'd come to the fair with me.

712
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,800
You know, I just thought
she might be weak, or that…

713
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,240
I just thought she might be weak, so…

714
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,240
'Cause everyone was calling her slag,

715
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,240
you know, or flat or whatever,

716
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,760
so I thought
when she was, like, that, weak,

717
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,840
she might… she might like me.

718
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,520
It's clever, don't you think?

719
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,080
To ask her out
when everyone else didn't like her?

720
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,360
Well, I went round
and said I was sorry and everything.

721
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,120
That Fidget was a wanker.

722
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,200
And I said I'd take her
to the fair if she liked.

723
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Her weakness made her more gettable,
was your theory?

724
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,000
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

725
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
I thought you said you didn't like her.

726
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,840
Uh, she's flat. That's a fact.
But I didn't mind that. That's okay.

727
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,880
I wore my best tracksuit
I could find, and…

728
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,040
I don't even know why I'm telling you
all this, but I just said,

729
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,760
"You wanna come to the fair?"

730
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,080
And what did she say?

731
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
She just…

732
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,920
She just laughed
and said, "Oh, I'm not that desperate."

733
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,720
And the emoji messages came after that?

734
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,720
Uh, yeah.

735
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,200
She was, let's say, attacking you
for presuming you could ask her out?

736
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,596
- Your words.
- You think they're unfair?

737
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:03,600
<i>You </i>think
she's a bitch, right?

738
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,160
Doing all that.

739
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,800
You think she's a bullying bitch.

740
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,520
She <i>was </i>a bullying bitch, right?

741
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,000
But that's the thing, you see?

742
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,200
That night, I didn't touch her.

743
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
I could've touched her,
but I didn't. I just…

744
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,560
I had a knife.
She was scared. But I didn't do that.

745
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,720
I could have touched any part of her body.
I really wanted to, but I didn't. I just…

746
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,000
Most boys would've touched her.

747
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,720
So that makes me better.

748
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:47,288
Don't you think?

749
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,960
I didn't… I didn't mean any of that.
I'm just tired.

750
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,600
I'm talking too much.
I'm tired. I'm just…

751
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,040
I'm so, so tired.

752
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:36,880
I didn't kill her.

753
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,280
Jamie, do you understand what death is?

754
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,440
- What?
- Do you understand what death is?

755
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Yeah.

756
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,080
You understand that Katie's gone
and she can't come back?

757
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,280
I didn't do it.

758
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,840
That whatever claims
you make as to her character--

759
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,200
- I didn't mean she was a bitch.
- Whatever claims you make, she's gone.

760
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,520
That whoever did kill her,

761
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,240
they extinguished the possibility
of her future life.

762
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,000
I didn't mean to be mean about her.
She just did--

763
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,360
- Jamie, listen. Do you understand?
- She just didn't like me.

764
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,040
Yeah, I'm not dumb.

765
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,400
- Do you understand that murder is a crime?
- Yeah.

766
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,320
You understand that if you're
found guilty, you'll be held in detention?

767
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,240
- Who doesn't know that?
- Understand who will make the decision?

768
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,360
- Judge. Jury.
- Okay.

769
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,640
Jamie, this is our last session.

770
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,800
What?

771
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,840
- What I would encourage you to--
- No. Why?

772
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,720
Take advantage of any mental health
services that are offered.

773
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,680
- No. Why?
- I think you'll benefit.

774
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,120
- No, I won't.
- Well, that's just what I think.

775
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,640
And then you come back. You see me?

776
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,840
Unfortunately, I'm needed elsewhere.

777
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,440
- It's just fucking done, is it? All of it?
- I hope you take what I said seriously.

778
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,600
- Thanks for your time. I'll ask Frank--
- Thanks for my time?

779
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,280
- Frank! I'm grateful that you've spoken--
- You think I'm being honest?

780
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,400
- Are you gonna tell the judge?
- I think you've spoken with honesty.

781
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,600
But all I'm advising the judge on
is your understanding.

782
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,404
My understanding, yes.

783
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,720
-It doesn't seem like a proper goodbye.
-It is.

784
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,880
-It doesn't seem like one.
-That's enough.

785
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,360
No, we haven't finished.

786
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,640
- We have. Thank you, Frank.
- No, no!

787
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,160
Can I ask you something?

788
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,800
Yes.

789
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:31,160
Do you like me?

790
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,280
- I was here as a professional, Jamie.
- Don't you think like that, then?

791
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,320
- My job was to assess you.
- Because I like you.

792
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,840
Not like that.
Not fancying you. Just as a person.

793
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,680
-Okay, son, come on.
-No, don't you even like me a bit?

794
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,560
What did you think about me, then?

795
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,680
-Decide, come on!
-This was really useful.

796
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,960
Don't you go fucking telling them
I did it!

797
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,520
- Don't you dare!
- Whoa, come on.

798
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,800
Don't you go fucking…
Get the fuck off me! Don't you dare!

799
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,120
- Hey!
- Fuck!

800
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,840
- Come on. Jamie, man, please.
- Don't you even like me a bit?

801
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,000
Okay? Jamie, come on.

802
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,080
- What did you think about me, then?
- Okay.

803
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,800
Just tell my dad I'm all right!

804
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,140
-Tell him that I'm okay!
-Jamie, you're hurting yourself.

805
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:20,520
-Tell him that I'm all right!
-Calm down.

806
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,022
Tell him I'm all right!

807
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:24,036
Tell him I'm okay, please!

808
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,400
Oh God.
