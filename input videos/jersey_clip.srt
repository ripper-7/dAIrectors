729
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,098
Wow! SG bat! Is this yours, dad?

730
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,808
- Where's mom?
- She's coming.

731
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:28,691
Dad, where are you going?

732
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,945
Back in time.

733
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,105
Dad... Fast! Fast! Mom's coming, dad.

734
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,058
Make it fast, dad.

735
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,078
Nani, want some milk?

736
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:51,978
No...

737
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,668
I'll also come, dad.
Please! Please!

738
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,693
No. It'll go on till late at night.
You'll have to go to bed.

739
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:05,280
Please, dad! Let me come with you.

740
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:09,785
I've never seen you bat.
Please, dad. Please!

741
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,560
No!

742
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:14,738
Sarah, I'm going to watch
a movie with Rajesh.

743
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:16,996
A movie?! Let me join you, dad.

744
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:20,176
Please, dad!

745
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:23,285
- Take him along. Tomorrow's his day off.
- Please, dad. Please, dad. Please!

746
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,143
Please, dad. Please! Please!

747
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:27,871
Okay, let's go.

748
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:29,312
Yay!!!!

749
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,303
Who's that? Bastard!

750
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,709
What does bastard mean, dad?

751
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,311
It means All the best!'.

752
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:46,253
Oh.

753
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,131
Slowly...

754
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:46,084
There's a place me and
your dad often hang out.

755
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,441
Let me take you there. Let's go.

756
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,966
Yay! Let's go!

757
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,652
- Thank you, mom.

758
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,908
Good morning, birthday boy!

759
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:09,561
Happy birthday!

760
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,496
How's the toy?

761
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:17,689
Hey, listen. Brush your teeth.
Go and hurry up.

762
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:18,840
I'll put this there.

763
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:28,789
Wow!

764
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:30,278
Happy birthday!

765
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,838
Thank you, dad.

766
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,689
On our way home from the match,
let's buy that jersey from uncle's shop.

767
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,080
-Really?
-Hmm.

768
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:45,681
I made dal and curry.
Boil rice an hour before lunch. Okay?

769
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:07,598
All the best!

770
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:08,705
Thank you, sir.

771
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,627
Hey, Nani!

772
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,103
Guys

773
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,705
Stop. Stop. Bowl now.

774
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,897
Do it now.

775
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:23,400
Stop.

776
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:24,908
Let's go. Come on.

777
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:27,494
I heard we have a new player.

778
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:34,589
Stop. Stop.

779
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:37,681
Arjun... You don't know him, do you?

780
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:40,650
Nandu... The best batsman in our club.

781
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,158
Arjun. Ex-Ranji player.

782
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:44,486
You must've heard of him.

783
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,111
No, I didn't.

784
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:49,208
In that case, remember him.

785
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,947
He might soon be the
club's assistant coach.

786
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,127
Oh. Is he playing?

787
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:58,096
What is this, sir?
Where were you this whole time?

788
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:00,259
Were you waiting for Gavaskar to retire?

789
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:05,347
By the way, you mentioned something
about the assistant coach's post.

790
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,080
Your place is secure, I hope.

791
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:11,892
If he concentrates well,
forget about my job.

792
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,017
You'll lose your place. Watch out!

793
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,353
Stop it, guys. Leave now.

794
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:20,025
Stop it.

795
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:21,454
Go.

796
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,347
Nani, go sit with Rajesh.

797
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:24,509
- Okay.
- Come. Come.

798
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,992
It's a big match for
Hyderabad Cricket Association.

799
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:29,268
They're getting to play New Zealand
in this charity match for Hope Foundation.

800
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:30,376
Hey! It's John Spearman. Look!

801
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:33,512
So, Hyderabad vs. New Zealand
at LB stadium.

802
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,912
Let's head to the toss.

803
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:36,395
- Shall we?
- Yes.

804
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,103
This is tails and this is heads.

805
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,650
- Tails.
- That's tails.

806
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:42,478
- You won the toss.
- I think we'll have to bat.

807
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:45,009
Good luck!

808
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:47,431
The atmosphere today at the
stadium is unbelievable.

809
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,872
John Spearman,
Captain of the New Zealand team...

810
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,772
Presenting a cheque to the Chairman
of Hope Foundation.

811
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,298
Yay! John Spearman!

812
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:56,150
Money would be going to the underprivileged
children for their education.

813
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,619
Look at that! Beautiful as they walk out.

814
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:05,275
Spearman and Andrew are opening
the batting for New Zealand.

815
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:09,455
They would like to use this match to get
used to conditions of the Sub Continent.

816
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,397
Almost like a practice match for
the New Zealand this must be.

817
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:15,353
Hyderabad would like to give a tough fight,
this being their home ground.

818
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:19,378
John Spearman opening the batting and
Nivas ready to bowl the first ball now.

819
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,650
That is driven handsomely to the off side.

820
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,639
First boundary coming off the first ball.
New Zealand off the mark.

821
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:29,830
Hyderabad giving away runs.
That's a bold shot again.

822
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,861
Pulled brilliantly and that's a four.

823
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,658
A great start for New Zealand and
a good partnership for the opening batsmen.

824
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:38,260
Let's see if this fiery war continues.

825
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:40,808
Here he goes again. That's a six.

826
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,463
Wonderful! Really wonderful!

827
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:46,789
Brilliant!

828
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,644
This team's making it a practice match for
New Zealand before the big series to come.

829
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:53,111
Here he goes again.

830
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:55,205
Bang! Out of the ground.

831
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,759
Hyderabad doesn't look pleased at all.

832
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,722
They haven't had a single breakthrough yet.

833
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:01,330
Hey...

834
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:04,055
Put those drums aside and cover them
with a cloth.

835
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,580
We won't need them today.

836
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,146
Chakri introduced into the attack.

837
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,430
His first ball and he is punished as well.

838
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:11,330
New Zealand leaving no
room for the bowlers.

839
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:14,689
New Zealand's having a run party.
They are only dealing in boundaries.

840
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:16,730
Andrew going in for the big hits.

841
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,447
And that's a boundary too...

842
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:19,889
Which brings up the fifty for Andrew.

843
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:21,236
Ball! Ball!

844
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:24,072
What an innings this has been!
The coach is very happy.

845
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,580
Very well in finding the gap.

846
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:28,821
That's it.

847
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:30,301
Oh, yes!

848
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:32,672
That's brilliant timing.

849
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:34,463
But there's a man there.

850
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,532
Good throw, dad.

851
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:38,736
Arjun saves runs for Hyderabad.
Excellent piece of fielding.

852
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,134
One run away from his century.

853
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,409
John Spearman hit the ball,
gets a single easily.

854
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,559
What a magnificent
innings this has been!

855
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,017
He has been a lightening.

856
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,867
He hasn't timed that one.
Gone straight to Nandan Reddy.

857
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,809
For a second, It looked like he dropped it.
First wicket for Hyderabad.

858
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,955
New Zealand setting a big total here.

859
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:58,376
Nicely driven.

860
00:09:58,789 --> 00:09:59,706
Swept away.

861
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,929
That's a grand total set by New Zealand
and more runs added to the total.

862
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:04,080
Hit straight for a six.

863
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,814
Hyderabad has a huge
task at their hands.

864
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
They need to hit 332 to win the match.

865
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,791
- Bro, want me to pull the drums out?
- Not yet. Wait for it.

866
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:12,327
Hi!

867
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,814
Pitch is quite bouncy.
They're literally smacking the ball.

868
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,970
So, boys... At least give them
a tough fight.

869
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,025
Don't go down so easily, okay?

870
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,033
We need 6.5 runs per over.

871
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,058
Nandu, do well.

872
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,208
Keep going. Keep going.

873
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,572
- Sir...
- Yes?

874
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:30,789
Arjun is a good player.
Shall we send him one down?

875
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:33,127
Oh. Do you want to get in after him?

876
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:34,901
Boys! Get going. Get going.

877
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:37,228
And I want all of you to play well.

878
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:39,322
It's okay.

879
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:45,619
Huge responsibility on the two opening
batsmen Nandan and Srikanth.

880
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,353
Hyderabad needs a good start.

881
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:50,963
They should make the most of the
field restrictions in the first 15 overs.

882
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,181
First ball. That crosses the boundary.

883
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:56,088
That's a great shot.

884
00:10:58,611 --> 00:10:59,403
Good shot.

885
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,947
James Wheeler in for the attack.
Oh! That's hit the pad.

886
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:04,306
New Zealand appeals and up goes the finger.

887
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,103
Hyderabad loses its first wicket
quite early into the match.

888
00:11:07,473 --> 00:11:08,972
Can we send Arjun in next?

889
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:11,497
Ugh, Mr. Murthy! Don't get started again.
Captain!

890
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:14,605
Required run rate rising and we have the
Captain of Hyderabad, Ravinder coming in.

891
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,004
That's timed sweetly.
The ball goes for a boundary.

892
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,279
Excellent shot! Fantastic!

893
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,470
That's wonderful!

894
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,564
The ball will go for a boundary.

895
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,400
Fifty runs partnership for
Nandan and Ravinder.

896
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:26,674
Nandan's two runs away from half century.

897
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,761
That's hit to the leg side.

898
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:32,161
Nandan Reddy completes his half century.

899
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:35,197
Brings much needed runs for Hyderabad.

900
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,798
Are you playing as well, sir?

901
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,908
Let me go get everyone then.

902
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,947
Oh, that is hit hard.

903
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,889
Fielder gets a finger on it but
that goes for a four.

904
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:51,127
That's a good shot.

905
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:52,869
Bro, want me to pull the drums out?

906
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:54,775
Wait on, man. I'll tell you when.
Hold it.

907
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:57,491
Goes again. The ball is in the air.

908
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,640
He should get it and that is caught.

909
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:00,811
Hyderabad loses
its second wicket and

910
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,271
Captain Ravinder walks
back to the pavilion.

911
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,103
Oh, damn.
Didn't I tell you?

912
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:05,387
Sir

913
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:06,889
-Sir
-Hmm?

914
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:08,340
If the next wicket falls...

915
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,513
If you keep bothering me,
I'll walk out of the ground.

916
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:12,163
Please!

917
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,296
New Zealand seems to be in control here
and that is bowled!

918
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:17,892
Can you believe that?

919
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,791
Hyderabad loses another wicket.

920
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,069
Sir...

921
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:29,134
Send him in.

922
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,705
Yes! Arjun, come on. Pad up.

923
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:40,105
Hyderabad in deep trouble now.

924
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,880
All the set batsmen have walked
back to the pavilion.

925
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:57,389
Sorry.

926
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,695
Wheeler has got 2 wickets
in the last two balls.

927
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:03,011
He is on a hat trick.

928
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,892
Let's see if he can do it.

929
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:07,642
Arjun is the new batsman at
number 5 for Hyderabad.

930
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:10,986
36 years old, ex Ranji player
facing the hat trick delivery.

931
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:13,666
Can he save Hyderabad from
an embarrassment?

932
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:22,181
Wheeler running to bowl,
will he get another wicket?

933
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,978
Oh, that is hit! What a stroke!

934
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:28,794
Denying the hat trick to Wheeler,
ball races to the boundary.

935
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,564
Good shot, dad!

936
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:35,814
That is as good as anything from
anybody at anytime.

937
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:37,766
Not an easy ball to play.

938
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:39,611
But he actually middles it.

939
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:42,127
Can Wheeler get a wicket this time?

940
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:43,970
Oh! He has hit is straight.

941
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:46,705
That is a good shot and the ball
is racing to the boundary.

942
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:51,189
Well played!

943
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,551
- Hit the next ball and show me, mate.
- What a start for this batsman!

944
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,415
This isn't going down well with Wheeler.

945
00:13:56,603 --> 00:14:00,228
Wheeler is an experienced bowler.
It's not that easy to attack him.

946
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm sure Wheeler is going
to answer back definitely.

947
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:07,784
Wheeler is considered as good as it
gets in this form of the game.

948
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,916
Last ball of this rollercoaster.
Wheeler over.

949
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:19,446
Front foot  full toss and
that's been hit high in the air.

950
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:22,012
We have no track of where the ball is.

951
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:25,579
Yes! There it is. It's out
of the ground. That's a huge hit!

952
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,025
If nothing, the crowd will get
their money's worth.

953
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,300
Bro! Pull the drums out now.

954
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,783
Come on, pull them out.

955
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:38,111
Wonderful! What a shot!

956
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:39,566
Brilliant!

957
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:44,892
And again well played.

958
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:49,205
It's going, going and gone.

959
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,687
Oh! What a performance this is already!

960
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:53,080
Thanks to this man Arjun.

961
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,834
Hyderabad seems to have got back
to this game already.

962
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,424
But it all depends on these
two players at the crease.

963
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,243
Chakri hits another shot.

964
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:07,226
Fifty runs partnership for Arjun-Chakri.
Bringing hope to the Hyderabad side.

965
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:09,043
Oh! He smashes through the covers.

966
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,173
Ball racing to the boundary.

967
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,887
And it's a four.

968
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:17,408
Hyderabad inching towards victory.
New Zealand disappointed.

969
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,986
Hyderabad needs just 45 runs in 30 balls.

970
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:24,236
That's a four again. Bowling change.

971
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:26,511
He goes on the front foot and misses.
That's out.

972
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,828
Chakravarthy walks back to the pavilion.

973
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:30,689
New batsman for Hyderabad.

974
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,465
New Zealand has that extra
fielder in the circle.

975
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,322
Don't want to give any run,
keeping Arjun on the non strikers end.

976
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:38,358
Bowled him. Austin Nash strikes.

977
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:40,861
The game now slipping
away from Hyderabad.

978
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:44,502
Oh, that's bowled again!

979
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:46,572
Hyderabad now in trouble.

980
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,597
8 wickets down! Vittal walks back.

981
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,627
Change of bowling.
Praveen, the new batsman...

982
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:52,652
Hits it in the air.

983
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:55,635
There is a man out there coming under it.
Will he be able to catch it?

984
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,161
And yes! He got the ball.

985
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:00,310
Hyderabad loses its 9th wicket.

986
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:04,854
Now this game is getting
interesting and really close.

987
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,254
Hyderabad needs 18 runs from just 9 balls.
Arjun on strike!

988
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,554
That's front foot. He hits it in the air.

989
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,954
Gone above the fielder into
the crowd for a six.

990
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:15,267
12 runs needed of 8 balls.

991
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,833
2 balls left of the over.
Here he goes again!

992
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:20,608
Ball in the air. Is it caught?
No! That's a six.

993
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:24,507
The match is again starting to
creep away from New Zealand.

994
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,282
They wouldn't want to lose it.

995
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:31,073
Looks like this man Arjun is going
to finish this match in this over.

996
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:34,764
Last ball of the over.
Oh, he goes again! Massive hit!

997
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,642
Is it going for a six?

998
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,190
Just short of the boundary. It's a four!

999
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,048
Hyderabad players are very happy.

1000
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:43,948
Hyderabad just needs two runs.
This is nail biting.

1001
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:46,015
It's a really tricky
situation for John Spearman.

1002
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,088
He cannot afford to
give away a run now.

1003
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,613
Fielder closing in the circle.
The first ball of the last over.

1004
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:52,198
Short. Dot ball!

1005
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,348
Wheeler getting all smiles here.

1006
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,521
Will Hyderabad get a run now?

1007
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,079
That's a bouncer and
he gets away with it.

1008
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,687
2 runs needed from 4 balls.

1009
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,917
Pressure building. Third ball.
Swing and miss.

1010
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:10,026
Now only three deliveries remain.
Hyderabad's so close yet so far.

1011
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:11,845
We've got 3 balls and
we only need 2 runs.

1012
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,823
Rotate strike. Don't panic.

1013
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:18,464
As the new batsman,
will he do it for Hyderabad?

1014
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:21,363
Can he take a single this time
to get Arjun on strike?

1015
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:27,244
Yes, he connects the ball.
Wanting the single. Arjun says no.

1016
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,646
- Go, go back.
- Confusion here.

1017
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,130
Sai going back. Will he be out?

1018
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,589
And New Zealand misses a chance
to finish off the game.

1019
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:36,655
No one's happy and that's
a terrible misunderstanding from Sai.
